Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Karen. When Karen got in trouble with her boss, and she had to spend her holidays cutting open people's legs to open them up for their organs to be harvested, someone told her she would be the perfect gift for the man who replaced her boss. Karen didn't go for it – she hated blood and wanted to give away as much of her life as possible to help the less fortunate, and especially the kids, who would also have benefited from her services. The gift was given to Joe, the guy who replaced Karen – and who also turned out to be a horrible psychopath. Karen also became the very first housewife to use all-natural household products, especially the oil she mixed from all-natural flower and food extracts. When it was finally discovered that Karen was making all-natural baby products that caused numerous miscarriages during her time, they ended up in her garage. Karen had to use old, rotten boxes, which eventually had some of the contents falling off the outside at her feet and into a giant pile – and that's when she was arrested for trafficking and murdering her own customers by giving them too much too quickly.

Now the real crime against Karen goes both ways. She did steal so much. She made things that helped many children have more. But if she had her choice, she would have loved to make only things that would have a positive effect for her daughter and the kid in her baby bottle.
