Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Cephas

Who had come from the East.

He had a great fat cow at his house. He did not eat meat

Or wear a leathern tunic,

For in his time neither cattle nor pigs

Were in use;

But whenever he found a fat juicy rib or a bone,

He took it into his hand and carried it to his house;

And whenever he found

Either some old, withered, gray-brown pig or an old, withered,

gray-brown cow to be sent to him,

He would take such as the owner's good fortune or

his good fortune had granted him,

And cut them up and fry them

Just as men used to do,

And the owner loved the meat

As much as the butcher loved it."

With all of his knowledge and wisdom about the future, Cephas knew about these things as well, and he used the future to guide his life.

And he was not the only one who looked ahead to the future. Pauline of Cleves was also a woman of many gifts.

In A.D. 1101, Pauline became an apostle to the Saxons, and in 1163, she traveled with her companion Abbot Hildulph and the Saxon king, Wulfhere, to Rome
