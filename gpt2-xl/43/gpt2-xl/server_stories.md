Once upon a time, there was a server named 'Folz', an example for the word 'Server'. The main feature of the server was that users could log on and leave logs, which were then searched by other users. Folz was not built by us, but by some community member.

A few days ago a player (we will call him 'M.S.') logged into Folz. From there, he took 'a brief walk through the code,' and discovered that someone had added a function to the server which made the server automatically print 'Folz is the best server, there is no other server quite like it.' It also had the ability to change the 'Folz' server name to 'Folz_G' and set every other text on the computer's display to 'Folz' when it was restarted. Folz's main website was changed to 'FolzG' and all the server's text was turned into 'Folz_G'.

'Folz' players did this, using command line scripts such as this one:

/msg Folz_G @user "I am currently logged out" "/message!user "I am currently logged out", 1.0

As for all their scripts there was no way of stopping it. They couldn't delete the web page that had all the logs and so on which was printed. They could also not update the server
