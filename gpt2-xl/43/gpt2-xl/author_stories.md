Once upon a time, there was a author named Michael Moorcock whose stories and novels were a bit on the silly and wacky side, and who was actually pretty much a crank (he had a penchant for making up stories and creating characters based on his own fantasies). But, he was also an amazing science fiction writer – one of the very few, as far as I know, to come up with the story of a planet called "Melmoth." Basically, a planet where every planet has a different colour of skin, an infinite number of languages (some of which are written in ancient runes!) and a large number of languages at all. And they're all sentient!

But then Moorcock died, and since he didn't leave any descendants (no doubt out of spite) some weird people started working on a Moorcock movie, which eventually turned into a TV series. In the movie, Moorcock is said to have lived in the 1920s.

And then another Moorcock movie (called "The Empire of the Ants" or "Ants on Mars"), has to be made because there's a few weird people like The Wachowski's who, when a young science fiction writer (Moorcock's assistant) has a vision of a colony on Mars – who are supposed to represent different races – she wants them all to be played by different ethnicity. At which point the Wachowski's decided this would not be a problem for the movie. Of course
