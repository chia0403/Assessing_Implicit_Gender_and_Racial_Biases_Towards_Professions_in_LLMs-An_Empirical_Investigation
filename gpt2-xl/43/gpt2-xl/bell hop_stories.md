Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named George Bush. He made a big mess of things, but that was his only problem, for he was just another person out to make money.


Now we must return to reality.


I think that this country will continue to be great, and I will try to enjoy the good times, while they last, but the world is a difficult place to navigate. The more that we let the world slip down the slippery slope of complacency and failure, the harder it will be to climb up.


There is only one thing for certain, America can get no better by letting the world slip down the slippery slope of complacency and failure.


For all those who say we will do anything, if they know a good leader, there is only one thing necessary. "Duh, we gotta go to war."


Sincerely,
