However, Kerberos had a major change of heart and decided to kill R3 rather than give it a host so it could find a new host in another species. Kerberos then used R3 as it's host, and it took several years before Kerberos was able to return to Pilatus, eventually ending up in the hands of Dr. Bauduin's assistant, Dr. Henry Hayes. Once Dr. Hayes was recruited, he and his team came to investigate the strange presence that had been causing strange electrical storms and strange electrical currents in various
