Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Bill. One night, Bill was in his room watching television when he heard the voice of a man on the radio. Bill picked up the remote and tuned to a program about the search for Amelia Earhart, and heard the voice again. There was only one problem with Bill's story: After every call, he got several calls back from callers who said they had heard the same transmission.

Bill wasn't an amateur; he had a professional job at a radio operation. He had checked the recording back and could tell the difference between the broadcasts. He went to his boss, who ordered him to get an engineer to listen over the air to see if there were another transmission. And he found a "couple," as Bill put it, who just happened to be in the same area of the country as he was. When word got back to the engineers in Alabama, they told Bill to keep an ear out for the call he had missed, even though it was long gone.

After years of the calls, and many, many false alarms, it became an obsession for Bill's sister, Bonnie Wilson. She read everything about Earhart online, and eventually decided that she wanted to buy the one call left on her brother's receiver. She'd heard the voice, but it was too late.
