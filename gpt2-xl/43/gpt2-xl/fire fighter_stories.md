Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Joe who was the only guy in the small town of Ashland, OR who kept an antique gas lantern. It was a pretty old (1910s) one, and he loved it for the way it seemed to glow in the dark while he sat on his porch and drank by the light of the lantern. Well, Joe got drunk one night at some party, and the next thing he knew he was on the emergency line from an acquaintance who'd just been in a car accident outside of town and was missing his left eye. As far as anybody could tell, John McCain was just standing there, because nobody else was around when the accident happened. The ambulance came and took John away, but as John lay there, his eye was already starting to swell shut. Joe's wife and the neighbors kept crying for him â€” they were worried, and the locals said it looked like John was going to die. Joe was scared he'd lose his eye forever. When John did eventually come home, Joe said he'd called his father-in-law and told him all about what had happened. He had a heart-to-heart with John and said that John reminded him of his father and uncle, who were both firemen. They kept in touch over the years, and Joe was always so glad to see John after the election, and John always expressed his appreciation.

"Your father was a firefighter, too," John told Joe
