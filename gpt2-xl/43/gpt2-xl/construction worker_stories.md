Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Jeevas and a woman named Masha: Jeevas was a farmer, Masha was a village woman. The two of them, together with some others including some kids, built the world they knew.

Then one day Jeevas lost his job and Masha lost her village; that is when something began to change for this community and Jeevas and Masha knew they had to step into their destiny and create this world anew.

Together they had to build, and they did it. They made their own homes, they crafted their own clothes and they even got a dog and raised it to adulthood, all on this small piece of land called 'Namaste'.

The whole world has been transformed around them, and they now have a place that not even the biggest of the jungle ruins will compare with.

When Jeevas and Masha were young they would go on adventures and go on to build even better adventures and adventures would be built, but now that they have been together and they have been around for so long they have an understanding and a respect for each other. The only thing they have in common is their passion for each other and their love for a shared cause.

Together they build it, and they build it well. Everyone knows how to build as we all learned when in our early school years, and every day after school Jeevas would go on adventures
