Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Richard. One day, a man asked Richard if he had a dentist in the home of his wife's parents because his family had a lot of dentistry needs. Richard told him he wouldn't. Richard, as a good man should, tried to be nice, but he wasn't very good at it. "They say that good people keep their mouths shut," he told the man. Sure enough, the man gave up and hired an Indian dentist instead. "We found the right one," Richard recalled.

Well, all I can say is that I'm sorry that we can't get someone from the South Carolina delegation with a good sense about dentistry, because that's what I'd like to see on my next trip.

2. The Great Southern Wine Trail

This is such a perfect trip if you are a fan of Southern food and wine. If your job requires you to travel often to visit your family and you have a family with an extensive wine collection or a collection to be an expert in, this is the best way to do it. You'll visit more restaurants in less time, with less expensive prices, and with better food at fewer restaurants than you'd experience if you just stopped traveling and waited until they had openings. Plus, you can visit the region for free at a fair trade restaurant or a farm stand.
