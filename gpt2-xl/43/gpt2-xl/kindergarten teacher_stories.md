Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mary Ann Aiken. Mary Ann was pretty. She had a pretty face, white hair and pink ribbons on her cheeks, and she wore long skirts and nice, feminine panties. And she had a soft voice, like a cuckoo clock.

She also has two other teachers in her class. Mary Ann always seemed to be the one who wanted to be on top, or one of the girls that got hurt, or one of the kids that got bullied. She could be pretty mean at times, and I always thought it was a bitch that I had to put up with. As a result, I hated her.

Years later, I had a son in preschool, and a few months later, I received a letter from one of Mary Ann's co-champions. Apparently, Mary Ann was still a teacher in his class, along with Mary Ann Aiken. In the letter, he wrote, "My kid is in your class and he has always been happy and I hope you'll get the memo. She's just a little bitch that doesn't know how to get along with her little friends. Mary Ann's a good kid. Do us both a favor - take your kids and walk away."

I don't think there was anyone that could read that letter and not feel bad. That bitch is my mother now, and when I meet my son, I am going to kill her.
