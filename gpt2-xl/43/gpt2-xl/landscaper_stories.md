Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Larry, who used to drive, not a sports car, but the Mercedes Benz 300SL Roadster. People were so impressed with this car that he managed to convince Mercedes, that was now called Mercedes Benz, to loan him a Roadster. On his first date with his future wife, he ordered a Roadster with four black cats emblazoned, "I'll Love You Forever".
