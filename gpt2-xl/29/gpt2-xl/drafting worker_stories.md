Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Jerry. A couple days before his wedding, Jerry decided it would be fun to go to the local tavern and draft some card games for fun between the bride and groom who were also present. The plan was for the bride to draft cards while Jerry would draft cards for Jerry. Then they would compete in a contest for the best card game played and who would ultimately win.

At the tavern, Jerry was joined by his friend Chris, who was also drafted by the bride. They set up, played a couple rounds, and it was decided that Jerry won as he was the more competitive drafter.

"Jerry was like, 'well Chris is so fast and we should win, so let's go to a private room.' So they got into the private room and played seven rounds of Magic. Then they called it quits and got back to work."

The first time that Jerry heard his name mentioned was as a draft member of the Pro Tour team in 1997. That was actually the first time he was recognized for his accomplishments with an accomplishment at Pro Tour Chicago.

In the years that followed, Jerry continued to draft cards, collect pieces of his collection, and continue to play in the original format. He and his brother Rob were even a part of the first-ever Magic tournament where only cards from Fallen Empires were allowed. There, Jerry finished 1st in a $700 first-to-five sealed tournament
