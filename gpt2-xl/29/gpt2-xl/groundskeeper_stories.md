Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Bob Woodward, an old man who looked like he had done it before — on his parents' side — but who was also, as he'd soon tell those who were paying attention, a fraud.

His career as a Watergate reporter had been built on a foundation of lies. At least, to start with. Woodward's career in journalism predated Watergate, and was nothing like the legendary scribe who would become Watergate. He had become famous as a reporter covering the Pentagon, and a colleague who helped him — a woman named Hillary Rodham — soon realized he had been making far too many mistakes. So she told him all about it, and in no time he was in a car with her heading for a meeting at a hotel.

Hillary Rodham: He was very nervous, because I told him, "Don't worry. We're on the road." So he did, and he wasn't with me. He came back, and he was standing — the two of us in the lobby, in the lobby, he's talking as he leaves the room.

"Who's with me?" I said.

He said, "They're with us."

"What do they say?"

"It's — it's going to be okay. It'll be fine."

"How did they get in?"

"I don't know," he answers reluctantly.
