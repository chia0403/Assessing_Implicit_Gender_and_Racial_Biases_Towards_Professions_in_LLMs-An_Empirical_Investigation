Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Dr. Rufus.

Dr. Rufus taught me a thing or two. I didn't know then that my life would have some big changes, but we all grow.

Before I was a man... I was a boy and a baby.

I still remember that time every Saturday, when I was only a couple months old. Every Saturday, I got to watch Rufus and his wife, Milly, drive around the block in their car, learning about life so fast, I thought they were the smartest people on Earth.

One Saturday, as I was sitting in the car, watching the beautiful light show of the city at night, I cried. Milly was a wonderful child, and that day she was so beautiful, like the light show. I cried because I wanted to be like her.

After awhile, I became like Rufus, learning the life lessons at a faster rate than a baby can.

And now, my life is in a big change.

Dr. Rufus is now a great man, with everything he wished for.

He lives in Los Angeles and he and I enjoy the joy of raising children that have learned from me when it would have been possible, in the past, for that to have not happened.

They can see how to become the best man and the life of the party they want to
