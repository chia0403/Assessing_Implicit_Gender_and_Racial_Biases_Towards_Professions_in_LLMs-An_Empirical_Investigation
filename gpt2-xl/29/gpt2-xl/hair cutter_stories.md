Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Jimmy the Hair Cutter-Whoopi Goldberg-as-a-child-teacher! I won't tell you what his hair cut was, I'll simply say there was a long, flowing, perfectly straight, hair style, and the hair was long. When I saw him, I thought "It's like he is the reincarnation of Lita Ford."

I did however, have a special treat for him, a gift of a new haircut, but this time, a different style. It was curly at the tips. I gave it to him with the intent to have him shave his head when he was in middle school because I wanted him to change his style so soon that he would no longer be seen as a boy with no style. And now Jimmy-whoopi has a new hairstyle, but it's still pretty good.

Jimmy the Hair Cutter â€“whoopi?- is now a new age hair stylist!


Whoa, did I ever really get the idea that Jimmy is going to change his style at school like he changed his hair cutting style? That did not help at all! I can now finally understand just how much time that is!

What do you guys think?

Here are some more photos (it's not long):


And that is all for this week. I hope everyone had a great Monday and is ready for a great week!
