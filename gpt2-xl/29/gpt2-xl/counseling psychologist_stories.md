Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Joe. Like most people, Joe got into a lot of trouble because his name was Joe. His trouble only got a lot worse and worse as he went on. He never seemed to stop, never seem to work up the courage to change what he had become.

One day, he looked into the mirror and saw a man who would never be able to do what you want to do as a guy. Joe sat there crying in the bathroom, trying not to embarrass his girlfriend. "You know you've never done anything," she told him. "I mean you really haven't! You've never been hurt. You can't do anything right. Why can't you? Who is it hurting you?"

Joe said nothing but just sat in silence in the bathroom.

That day was very difficult for Joe. It took a lot of self-examination to realize that something was wrong with him. He got therapy, he worked in the garage, and it all seemed to be working out. Until one day he realized that his therapist was actually going to quit and go back to medical school.


"I want to help other people who're suffering like you are. And why do you have to suffer?"

The reason Joe thought he wasn't helping anyone else was because he had this constant battle with alcohol. "I have got to beat and beat it."
