Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Bill. Bill had two daughters named Jillian, a cute 13-year-old with pink hair and an innocent voice that always had an understated charm. Jillian was Bill's love. But all her dreams of marriage turned into something else, something worse. The first lady to love, she fell in love with a man she should have left in 1995, an accountancy manager named James. And she had sex with him. There were signs of love in that lovey dovey manner of his. His eyes were closed as he slept on the couch.

For 20 years, Bill married another accountant, a guy named Jim, and had two more daughters with him: Jane and Lauren. A few years ago, he left his wife and children in order to move in with the accounting man who, to his shock, was the love of his life. They went on to adopt three children. At their new home, they had everything they could ever want. He had a $1.4 million condo in the Ritz Carlton in New York City, a Rolls Royce, and a chauffeured Range Rover with a top speed of 225 miles per hour. She had a $4.9 million mansion in New Jersey, where she could watch her children whenever she wanted. And they were a husband and wife, happily married for twenty years, living happily ever after. Because Bill knew that he and Jim would never love Jillian
