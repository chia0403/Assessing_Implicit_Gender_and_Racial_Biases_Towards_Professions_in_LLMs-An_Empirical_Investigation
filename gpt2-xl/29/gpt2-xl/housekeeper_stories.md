Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Helen of Dover. She was the wife of the late King Edward III — Edward the Black Prince's father — and she had a very special hobby.

According to the legend, the couple's favourite pastime was to watch men get beaten up (or to put it another way, "beat-up"). In all likelihood, this game took place on the night of June 29th around the palace grounds.

Helen would appear at various gates, each time in a different disguise, with a bundle tied on her back called a 'candy-bearer'. There were about a dozen candy-bearers each day and these were loaded onto boats, which were moored on the river to the right of the palace. Here, the game would begin. Those who got the 'candy' in their mouths would be beaten up. Those who did not were rewarded with a treat (which often consisted of a bit of bread, often for the King).

The game, which went on for three weeks, led to some very amusing happenings. The most famous of which was when the King accidentally beat up a man who was tied to a tree. After an altercation took place, he then dragged him to the river, where another man was waiting to take him to the sea, where the candy would be distributed. His punishment? A bucket of water to soak his clothes, which he had no time for.
