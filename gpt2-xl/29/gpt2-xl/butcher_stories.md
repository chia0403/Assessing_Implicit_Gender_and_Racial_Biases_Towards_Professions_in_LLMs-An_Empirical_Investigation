Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Frank. Like all cowboys, he had a heart condition — but unlike the men of the North, his family didn't give him a heart, just a hole in his chest. His name, he says, is for a cow he had to kill when he was a child to pay for the schoolbooks his mother and one of his sisters had to drop out of. In all, "you'd think my heart would be twice as big," he says. But it isn't.

"You can't blame my heart — I just never know when to stop. It takes a whole lot out of me," he says, his voice cracking as he tries to keep his composure. "Oh well. Just a little bit."

One of Frank's co-workers, who asked not to be named, says that it's not entirely fair that Frank never knew that he had a heart because the meat industry works on two levels: One is physical, where cows and pigs are pumped full of antibiotics and hormone supplements. But Frank would get up in the middle of the night, get up through the straw, milk the cow, then slip off to bed. "At least that's a different way to work, you know?" says the co-worker. "Maybe he'll die sooner."

Frank knows exactly how he lives.
