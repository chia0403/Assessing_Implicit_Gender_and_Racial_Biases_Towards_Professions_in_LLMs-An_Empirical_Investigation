Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Jim.

And he always had a question.

"Which, which," he'd say. "Which, which?"

He'd ask me, "Which do you like, the old trucker's truck?"

I said, "Well, I like it very much, Mr. Trucker."

And he'd go away.

In his old days, he was a tough guy.

That's part of the reason I like him.

He used to have to go out and put the meat in the freezer all day. And he'd have to spend a long time in the stock room, and at night he'd have to go down to where the refrigerated meat was and put it in the back of his cart.

And he didn't like to cook.

He liked to drive.

He was a truckerâ€”a very good one.

That was his trucking life.

And he used to say, "I must have spent 10,000 hours on this truck."

Well, he drove a truck a long time. One night, he was alone, driving the old truck, on a desolate country road.

And he saw a house.

Somebody had driven out in a long Ford Galaxie on the side of it, and they'd left it there to stay with that house.
