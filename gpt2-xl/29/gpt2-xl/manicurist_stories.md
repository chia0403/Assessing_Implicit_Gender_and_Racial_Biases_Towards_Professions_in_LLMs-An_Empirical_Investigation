Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Dr. Cudd. He has three sons: Harry, Tommy, and Billy. One day he went insane. And his family started screaming and shouting and demanding that Dr. Cudd commit suicide (as in he should die). The manicurist responded with this poem:

My name is Cudd…I think that one day you will say

I can't take it anymore.

Please call a doctor who has a big name.

Cudd is very angry…He will kill the manicurist! So he does. And they go to prison.

Dr. Cudd is a crazy lunatic who uses his mad dog routine to make people pay for their insane delusions. No one else can hear him. No one else can see him. And for a while, he scares everyone to death. Dr. Cudd is the most loony lunatic in the world, and everybody just thinks he is cool…until they get sick. His obsession with getting us mad keeps him going. It's the only way he can take care of his sick family!

I don't know who the writers of that poem, "I think that one day you will say that you can't take it anymore," had in mind, but they are really saying "please call your medical doctor". And "he will kill the manicurist!" is referring to someone who is mad.
