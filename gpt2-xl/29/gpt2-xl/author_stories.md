Once upon a time, there was a author named Ayn Rand (no relation to our dear president). She got to read the play before it was staged. She found it "revolting." She found the dialogue "abhorrent." She thought the plot "absurd." She thought the world was full of "abominable people." She thought that the people who were praising Rand as a genius were nothing more than pussies. She thought the women were ridiculous and selfish, and that those men who were praising her were nothing but pimping pieces of shit. As with all good authors, Rand's moral compass was different; her own life and her own opinions were never wrong. That's right, she thought women could be really stupid, selfish, and pathetic in the same sentence. The only thing that was wrong with her was that she was an asshole.

That's exactly how Donald Trump is currently portrayed in the press. People see and hear this big, boorish, brash man and think: "Wow, I bet if I could just become president, I'd get this guy." But Donald Trump is not Ayn Rand. Donald Trump is, in fact, Donald J. Trump. He was always stupid and selfish. He was always, always a misogynist, a bigot. He was always a scumbag, a sexist, a bigot, and a misogynist. He is the same man you would have voted for for president if you
