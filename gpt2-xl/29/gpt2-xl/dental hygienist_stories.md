Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Judy. Her name was inspired by a "Jaws" episode as she was a dental hygienist-in-training (hence the name), and she was just so obsessed with the dentist. After the hygienist graduated, she opened a dental spa. She soon got an agent in a chain of restaurants (one in Manhattan, one in Queens), and she was soon doing all of her business from her office. At one point she lost her job when another dentist quit, but somehow, she got another job on a different floor. One day, she was walking down 59th Street and was forced to cross the street to go to her sister's wedding reception. She thought it was the height of irony when one of her neighbors (who was also a dentist) ran out to congratulate her on her new position. She got the feeling that the other dentist's office was the one she was at. After going over the schedule and finding it impossible to find a dentist on that floor, Judy was forced to resign. Today we know that she was right; she was at the incorrect floor. The next day, the other dentist called her, and made a promise to get her a job at his clinic.
