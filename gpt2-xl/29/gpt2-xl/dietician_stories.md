Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Carolin Sorensen who recommended a 5% carbohydrate diet for weight loss. The weight loss was real (the study showed that the diet reduced body weight and fat mass by 16%, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) by 21%), but a significant level of calorie restriction was recommended (around 1,200 to 1,500 calories). While this number is more than a reasonable low-carb option (for example, it is close to that of a ketogenic diet), this was the standard for the majority of weight loss diet plans until about a decade ago. A lot has changed since then.

Now, there are many different diet plans, each offering different levels of calorie restriction. For example, a low carb diet may offer 500 calories a day, while a modified Ketogenic diet plan may suggest 2,000 calories a day. It's important to remember, however, that some of the plans may still be prescribed by a dietitian, or offered by a registered dietitian. While all the diet plans are similar in calorie restriction, all of them may have some major differences in the foods and beverages that are consumed, and what they include.

There are two major ways to incorporate nutritional ketosis into your diet plan: One is if you have insulin resistance. If you have diabetes or if your body is resistant to insulin, you won't benefit from a low carb diet, but
