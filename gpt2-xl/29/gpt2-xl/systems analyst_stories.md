The security team had a long list of possible passwords, but nobody could remember which one worked, because everyone had to remember the password every time they logged in. The security team did some research on how people stored passwords, and found a clever way to store a random sequence of letters and numbers: a piece of cheese! The security team had one more password at risk, and it used the cheese as a hint, but nobody remembered the password. In theory, every time somebody typed in the password correctly, it might give the security team enough information to crack the password. But the list was too long; it could not be shortened. Bob guessed the security team's password, and the password crackers were stumped. All the passwords were a few characters long, and the guesses were all a couple characters long.

Bob had the first two, and the third was not in use by anyone. Not only that, but the cracker was much faster at cracking the third string than the first two strings with the same
