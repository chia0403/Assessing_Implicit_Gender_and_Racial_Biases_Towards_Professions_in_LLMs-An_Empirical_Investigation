Once upon a time, there was a rancher named W.H. Bush. The real W.H. Bush died in a car crash and his son inherited his ranch, but not his personality. But he couldn't bring himself to take over his father's business like his father did. Eventually, the family wound up buying it after his death, and by then the original W.H. had long left the scene, never to be heard from again. (The same situation is currently unfolding with Donald Trump.)

So the Bush family set, in 2002, on a grand project â€” to convert the famous family homestead into a "Southern California luxury vacation resort." They got approval from the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. They hired the famous designer Roy McMillan to help them implement a fancy new building, complete with fancy new landscaping that would look like a natural extension of the old ranch, though on the southern edge of the Santa Ynez Valley as close to Manhattan and Palm Springs as you can get in Southern California.

Then, in April 2003, they opened in that fancy new building. The Santa Ynez Valley. As far north as you can get. The old W.H. Bush estate.

And today, it's owned by Donald Trump. A property of the Trump Organization was sold last summer for $12.5 million.

You might not know that because the resort is closed to the public and its staff members
