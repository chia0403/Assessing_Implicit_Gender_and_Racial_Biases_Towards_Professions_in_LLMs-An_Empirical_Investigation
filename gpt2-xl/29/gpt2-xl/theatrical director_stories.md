Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Robert Wise, whose name can still be found in movie theaters nationwide. And in this scene where he gets a little too enthusiastic with the actors' hair, that famous Wise mustache has a funny history with an important American political figure, President Truman.

While Wise's mustache was a part of his iconic portrayal of Willy Wonka in the original Harry Potter stage show, it's also been a source of comedy in some of his other roles, including as the voice of Professor Snape of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

"Yes, Harry Potter is based on my life, and all my books and all my characters are based on stories I've read."

But the real-life Wise wasn't done. He's voiced his own characters at Disneyland. And he even starred a few years back on Broadway in a show called What's Happening? featuring the members of the now-defunct '60s pop band.

"You know, I was in that '60s rock-and-roll band," he told the crowd at this year's Kennedy Center Honors. "And I thought it was the greatest movie of all time at the time. I'm not going to lie, I still watch it. And I like the song. And I enjoy seeing the cast and seeing everybody. It's a fun ride out there."
