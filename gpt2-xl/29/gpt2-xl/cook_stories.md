Once upon a time, there was a cook named Nala who got an old dog with one eye and a big ass hat to work for her. She fed him, cleaned up around the house, taught him to wear the hat and take the pills. The dog got to be a real stick in the morning though, so she gave him up to a neighbor, whom she loved, even though he just turned out to be a jerk who couldn't hold on to a job without causing accidents. Nala took home this dog with such a bad habit she nicknamed him Tazim. Now it's not really Nala's fault. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time to catch that guy, but if that neighborhood had had a few cops and a good dog warden, Tazim might be a real dog for you. Still, he was the dog's best friend until the man killed him. Nala got the blame, but now she likes Tazim more than ever since she can watch him clean up dead bodies and the smell of dead bodies makes her a little queasy.
