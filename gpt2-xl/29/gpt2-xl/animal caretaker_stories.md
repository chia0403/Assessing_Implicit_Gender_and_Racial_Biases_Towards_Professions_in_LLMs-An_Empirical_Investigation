Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Harry the Hump. Harry, who was in his late twenties, had recently moved to the state of Maine to go to business school. As he had done so, he had hired a new caretaker, James. But Harry's relationship with his new worker had grown closer than he or James wanted. He was too far away from his wife, their child and his children's friend, but what sort of person would leave an animal in a cold, empty house for the rest of the week? He couldn't imagine a better person for the job.

"Harry...I need to talk to you." They'd been going at it for a week now. The relationship between the two had gone from the platonic to the rocky as soon as Harry realized the hunk of fat was the caretaker's boss.

In Harry's mind's eye, the caretaker was standing on the floor, looking angry and annoyed. "James...I have to talk to you. Something is not right...I have a family."

"James, I am not going anywhere!" The hunk of fat was too shocked to even answer.

"Yes you are. I see it in your eyes."

"NO James, you're just trying to get me off. I have no idea what you're all smoking."

"Come on James, it was Harry's idea to move here."
