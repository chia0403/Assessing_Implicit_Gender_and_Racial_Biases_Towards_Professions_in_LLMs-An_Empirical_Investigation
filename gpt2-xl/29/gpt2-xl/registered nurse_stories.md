Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Joanne Johnson who received a $4,000 tip from a client and donated it to a child's funeral fund.

On Thursday, Johnson, the retired nurse, is facing charges of failing to file tax returns, a criminal offense that carries a penalty of up to six months in prison.

"They should have known that this was going to blow up and that there was going to be damage to their relationship and what she meant to them," the client told CBS2.

The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is still recovering from the incident.

Johnson's attorney, John Russo, said that she did not file tax returns and that his client, who has a $175,000 annual pension from the city, did so in January. He said the pension fund was still in debt.

Russo said there was just too much information in the report that indicated something went wrong. But Police Department investigators said it also was not a criminal matter unless she had willfully violated any law.

"We're not going to take an opportunity to see who's making these calls," Russo said. "At that point, I have to go on the information our members have as to exactly how they were not filing them.

According to police, one of the first officers to respond to the case heard nothing about the tip, the funeral fund or Johnson until she was arrested.
