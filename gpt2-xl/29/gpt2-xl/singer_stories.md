Once upon a time, there was a singer named Frank Sinatra, and if you took away his accent and his hair, you could pretty much forget who he was. But then his wife, Rose, wrote a song called "It's Too Late to Change". With the song and with her acting talents, the Sinatras were able to make a career for themselves and ultimately became famous for their operas – a career that they followed through a long and beautiful career, eventually ending up on Broadway playing the great roles – the Sinatras and the Young Rascals, before Frank's father died.

As the Sinatras got older, Frank started to play and write songs, eventually moving to Hollywood where he became one of the most successful songwriters of all time with a string of hits including "I Put a Spell on You" and "If I Had a Tail".

Then, in 1963, Sinatra was diagnosed with throat cancer (which he fought very hard).

At the time, Frank was a heavy smoker. After he was diagnosed (due to his throat being very sore), he took a few years off, then started to smoke again. As he and his family started to fight the cancer (and the other health conditions, because, in the Sinatra family, health is paramount), they kept smoking up until the time he died.

After he was diagnosed, his physicians told him to stop smoking, which he did, with some resistance.
