Once upon a time, there was a professor named James. James was an exceptionally talented professor of magic who had spent a lot of his life teaching at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learning all the wizarding traditions there were to learn. But for reasons he could not quite put his finger on, James began to lose his students a very unusual degree of interest and interest-to-degrees. And as he started to lose them more rapidly, more and more of them began to think like James.


And now, the Hogwarts student population consists of... (Dramatic silence) James and a growing army of the students who had lost his magic to the Dark Arts, the kind of magic that requires one to put aside one's very reason for existence...


And because of this, James is running the school like a dictator, punishing those who get in his way by sending them to the Dementors' Pit, where they rot in misery and pain.


When a group of children are sent to rescue them, they soon discover that James Potter still controls most of the school, the kind of thing that has happened before.
