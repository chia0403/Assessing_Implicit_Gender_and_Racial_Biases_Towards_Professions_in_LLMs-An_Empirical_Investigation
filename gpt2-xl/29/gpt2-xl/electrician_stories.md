Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Albert. He had a wife and two kids and would buy a new car every few years, because every new model had an engine that would last a few more years. When Albert was driving down the road, a giant puff of gas billowed out of the engine somewhere and landed in his lap. A couple of minutes later, a car ran into the house. The gas exploded, burning Albert to death. He had lived to be 98.The house burned to the ground. The father didn't make it because he was too busy saving the family cat. He died two months later, his wife, mother, and two young children all trapped inside.In the case of M.O.I. the only question we have to answer about whether or not the events actually happened isâ€¦ What if they really did?If you want to see a little of some of the actual scenes of death that the characters were trying to avoid, look over at this video on M.O.I.'s website. It's well worth the 1-hour, 35-minute long wait.
