Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Dick Johnson, and he had a thing with a man named John Fitzgerald Bosenko. Bosenko was a former spy, and the two men had an ongoing romance and it eventually landed them married. Dick, who hated his job, decided to move out of Manhattan and pursue his love in Paris. He was successful, with Bosenko even proposing, but not before one of his private eyes murdered Bosenko's lover and made him believe he had committed the murder. While Bosenko knew that it's likely Dick was behind his murder, he still felt strongly about their love affair and was deeply disappointed. Bosenko tried to kill him again - without success - and he eventually left Paris with his family. In Paris, he had a drink and was offered a job by an old friend of Dick's, who asked him to catch a woman named Mary. Mary was a woman who was having problems with her husband. Dick agreed, and he quickly tracked down and caught up with Mary. Bosenko had been sent to kill her, and when Mary asked to see her husband, Dick offered to help get him out of the country. But Mary and her husband soon got into a fight over who would be the next mistress of Dick. Dick shot Bosenko and then took his place in the fight and took care of the woman as well. Afterward, Dick realized that Bosenko may have gone after Mary instead,
