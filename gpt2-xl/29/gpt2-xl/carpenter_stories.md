Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Peter. He was married with three children, and he worked in the brickyard, and he raised a family and he owned a house for sale. And he loved his wife and his children and his home and his family, but he could not bear that they were not rich. He could not bear it. And Peter went to his God and he said, It is my time now; I will build a church upon this land. And he built a church. The people came to him, and he baptized them. He built a school and gave books to his children, and he fed and clothed and led them in the Lord's service and he was honored and trusted and loved in the Lord. And the people began to think how they could get him to build more houses. Peter always wanted to build more houses, and they asked him when he went to work. And he responded by saying, If you will give me a little land -- I'll build you a house. And when they did he built them more houses, and they had very many more children. And the Lord was very proud of them, and the people began to say, How can a carpenter build more houses? How can a carpenter build a thousand houses in a day? And Peter said to them, "God has a plan, even a greater plan in store, for he knows the good that I will do and will give me the means to do it
