Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Jerry, and he and his wife were very proud of their "tax software."

One day, though, Jerry quit his job to open his own business â€“ which turned out to be "an income tax software system." But, with all his newfound income, Jerry also suddenly found himself with lots of extra cash and no use for all the unused software.

He realized he needed to "fix" his income tax system. What kind of system would allow him to be in charge of his own income while also spending it?

Jerry's System

At first, all Jerry wanted was to file his income tax on a daily basis. Then he wanted to pay his bills on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Even his bank account transactions couldn't be interrupted. His day would start with a quick calculation that determined the amount that would need to be paid that day. That was the beginning.

Over time, the system grew and evolved. With the right tweaks, he could quickly assess his income, analyze his expenses, and even change his taxes if he was required to. Not all tax payers have the luxury to spend a week tweaking their taxes. Jerry did it in about 20 minutes.

Jerry's system was simple enough that he could teach it to any competent income tax preparer in under 20 minutes. And, for a while, he thought, "This is my best idea ever."
