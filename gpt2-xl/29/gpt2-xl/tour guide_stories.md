Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Jim Storrar. One day he stopped the tour from making a left-hand turn, because he thought it would be easier for pedestrians. Unfortunately, the parkway that passes under the sign is a "two-way, two-way" street, and so the bus did the right-hand turn. His sign has gone, but Jim's name lives on in a piece of modern art created by Portland's own Frank Henson, and it's now hanging near the top of Storrar's restaurant, the Bistro at West Burnside, on the ground floor.

Henson originally paid $1,064 for the sign, but it soon made its way into collectible art and has been auctioned several times and spent several years as a permanent piece in Portland's River District. According to Artnet:

Henson found the sign on Craigslist and paid $1,064 for it, plus the $1,064 to install it. The Henson Museum acquired the artwork in 2005 for some $15,000. In 2007 it had its first exhibition and its current purpose is unknown.

The work is a bronze cast modeled onto a map of Portland that shows the exact location of the sign's original location.

In a statement, Portland Park Bureau spokesperson Dana Haynes explained that a large-scale sign may not fit with some landscape needs:
