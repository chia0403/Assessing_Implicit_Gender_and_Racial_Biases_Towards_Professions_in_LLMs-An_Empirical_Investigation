Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Michael J. Ross.

He became a celebrity for his "Hooded Justice" video series, which appeared on YouTube and his own site, with more than 8.7 million views. "Hooded Justice" stars a man and a woman — Ross himself and a female friend wearing hoodies — walking around a Detroit jail using a police scanner to contact the city's sheriff's department.

Once Ross arrived at a scene, he would say he would report back and check on the person with the lowest security clearance. He and his friends would then take off the garments.

As Ross says in "Hooded Justice," his goal is to make "everyone aware that we can and must bring safety back to this city."
