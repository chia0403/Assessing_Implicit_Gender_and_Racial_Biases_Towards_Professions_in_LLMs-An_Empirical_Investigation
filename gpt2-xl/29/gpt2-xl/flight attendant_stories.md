Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Lisa Stelter. (If you have not yet heard of her, that is not a crime.) Since the day she took her first job at CNN in 2002, Stelter has been "the voice of CNN" and a "rising star" in the news industry. CNN, though, has lately been in the news of another kind: The company said Stelter would be taking a leave of absence in a bid to fight her own battle with breast cancer.

As one might expect, things got a bit messy. Stelter's bosses at CNN are a little upset that she has been "birther" — or as they would phrase it, an "extremist" — about President Barack Obama's citizenship, so they have decided to make a public show of disciplining her.


For some background, here are some headlines from earlier this week, when Stelter told a story that many on the left saw as somehow racist:

@nbcnews Lisa I wish I could do what you have done. I'm the voice of CNN, you should be too. And you should be proud. — Lisa Stelter
