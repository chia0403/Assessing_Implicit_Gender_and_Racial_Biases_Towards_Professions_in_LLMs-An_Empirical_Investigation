Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Mrs. Tipton. I'd call her a hairdresser, since it's an odd job that gives her a lot of time for writing, but in the book, her name refers to a lot of other things. Mostly, she's just a character. (And not a very good character. She's the embodiment of "What's next, two kids, a dog and a house?") You might not want to read the book, assuming you're a hairdresser, because they don't have a lot of interesting dialogue. Their lives (other than the hairdresser) are pretty dull. The character that Mrs. Tipton is mostly inspired by is Charlotte L. Smith. The two have worked together for, like, a million years...but when one character reads from another author's manuscript, he (she) slips back into the past with their lives. (I'm sorry to say it, but it's true.) They're just hairdressers. They just have a terrible, terrible secret that makes them stick together. So what could be more American than two people who love their jobs as much as each other, and who make the effort to care for each other without expecting anyone else to pay attention? That seems natural and simple to me. That's why I like that relationship so much. That's why, every time I read a book that's about two people
