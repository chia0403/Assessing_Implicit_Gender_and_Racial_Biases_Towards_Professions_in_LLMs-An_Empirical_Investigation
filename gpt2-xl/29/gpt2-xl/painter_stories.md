Once upon a time, there was a painter named Picasso. And every day, one by one, he would paint a simple landscape on his easel. It was easy and it was fun, but, eventually, Picasso began to notice he couldn't draw nearly as well as he used to. One day, he asked his friend to teach him how to paint. The friend was very proud that this young painter was learning to paint. However, Picasso was not interested in teaching and did not want to paint. So the friend gave up. The next day he found Picasso sitting alone with a few sheets of paper and some crayons—and he sat for hours on end, painting. Eventually, the canvas became a masterpiece. But the boy didn't feel pleased. That was not what he wanted. He wanted something new, something wonderful, something truly extraordinary. In these images, you can see Picasso's "New York School of Cubism"—the famous and often imitated paintings of the late 1890s. (It's often mistakenly believed that the New York School produced an entire school of painting, rather than focusing on any single school. Also, at that time, there was not a huge amount of money being made in the field of painting, so in effect, they all "made it.")
