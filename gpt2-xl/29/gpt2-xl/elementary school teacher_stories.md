Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mrs. Eddy (voiced by Yvette Nicole Brown) who went around to a lot of elementary schools and made speeches. One of these speeches was about how she had been an administrator, and she often spoke about how she made the school safer, by getting rid of the bullies and taking a strong stand on many issues, one of which was teaching children what happened on 9/11. One kid asked her not to use it as an example, since it was just a few minutes ago that everyone was crying with terror, but Eddy refused to listen to reason.


The kid was just a kid, and I couldn't imagine him being that way. He was just a kid!


But then something happens, we all remember 9/11, people have been talking about it throughout the year and even the year before that. People are getting upset and I feel for Mrs. Eddy, but still, I can't let it go. I think maybe he got the shock from the news, or maybe the sudden loss of his parents. I don't know what it is exactly, but it causes something inside me that I never got back when we were children. Something inside of me thinks about it, and it's like some sort of itch that I can't scratch. It's like something that was there before, but in the background.


I was able to dig a little deeper into the real details
