Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Frank Calcagno. One day he was on a call, patrolling at the corner of St. James Avenue and South Wabash when his ladder fell into a burning building. Frank, already wearing a hardhat, pulled himself from the flaming frame and crawled to safety.

But instead of doing the right thing, Frank decided to put the fire out with one of his own "fire blankets," fashioned from a pair of latex boxer shorts. And Frank saved no one, as there were no bystanders to witness this dangerous stunt.

For years, "Fireman" has been a staple of the St. Louis scene's folklore, but the city has not kept Frank's memory alive. We need you to change that.

Frank was never given a "funeral," just a monument in his honor. But he is still remembered well beyond St. Louis. Frank is one of the bravest firefighters in the world.

For a city filled with fire trucks and firehouses, Frank stands out as being a man of the people, a dedicated firefighter and a beloved figure.
