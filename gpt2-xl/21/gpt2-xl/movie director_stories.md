"The good news is that, unlike a lot of things, I don't have a lot of bad ideas, so I had a lot of good options."

And so he made "Schindler's List", which, of course, became an incredibly successful blockbuster. But this wasn't always the case. Here's a sample of Steven Spielberg's career so far, broken down by decade:
