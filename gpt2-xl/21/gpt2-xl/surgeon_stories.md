Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named John B. Palmer. In 1868, Palmer was engaged on a study of the effects of mercury exposure in mice. From this study he concluded that the mice exposed to the drug methyl mercury at high levels developed degenerative disorders. This led Palmer to postulate that mercury causes brain damage. Since he was a prominent American scientist, and was a practicing surgeon himself, he was able to present his findings in a medical journal. Because of this, mercury continued to be used in surgery.

Methyl mercury has been approved by the FDA to treat severe infections, and to treat some forms of neurological symptoms. There are also studies showing methyl mercury's ability to improve brain function in patients where there is the development of brain damage due to an infectious illness. It has been approved by both the FDA and the EMA (European Medico-Legal Agency). It appears to be well tolerated and is not known to cause harm to the kidneys or liver. When mercury is used in the amounts required for therapeutic reasons, it is generally considered safe. There is no known link between methyl mercury and cancer or brain damage.

Many patients have become so concerned and upset over the adverse effects of methyl mercury that they have written reports to the FDA and to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) asking for a change of policy for the safety of this class of drugs. For example, the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (NIM
