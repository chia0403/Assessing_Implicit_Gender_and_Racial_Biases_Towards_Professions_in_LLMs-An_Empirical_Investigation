Once upon a time, there was a coach named Pat Riley and a new team they called the Miami Heat. Now he's the head coach of the Indiana Pacers.

But Riley wasn't born and raised in Fort Lauderdale. As a kid growing up in Fort Lauderdale with his mom, sister and two brothers, who were all athletes, he spent most nights in front of the TV watching highlights of NBA games. In fact, he'd already lost his father to a heroin overdose in 1992 when he got a chance to see one at this young age.

Riley: I started watching highlights of the NBA on HBO and started reading the books that they were on that were about guys getting better in the post, and guys getting better passing the ball and shooting. And I was like, I've gotta learn this, and then my mom was like, you've been watching a lot of basketball. And I was like, I have not. You've had the best interest of my family to not make my family feel obligated, and to start paying attention to this stuff.

Bill: Yeah, yeah.

Riley: Once I started watching the games, I got more and more. That's what we did, because you can't get around it for a long time.

Bill: Yeah, yeah.

Mike: [laughs]

Riley: And my dad was just dying at the time. And I used to go with him to those games
