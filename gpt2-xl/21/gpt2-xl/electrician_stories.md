Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Robert Bock that sold electricity in an underground tunnel. It was a long and dangerous job. The job was done by a team of workers and it would have required at least 60 workers. The other men working there only had enough tools to cut into the brick of the building and take out the wiring. They couldn't fit a drill, a hammer or a sledgehammer to the job. Robert Bock, to save the lives of the workers spent a fortune and built a powerful magnetron- a machine that allowed him to drill through brick and into the earth! It's the sort of job you could only be given by an expert. He also put in a battery bank to work with the machine. He could charge a battery by the hour, allowing him to work on the job. His wife, with her hands in everything, worked in the factory to provide the electricity for the factory. She used all sorts of materials from copper wire to plastic bags to keep up the battery bank. She didn't mind the risk.

But the bricklayer started to work long hours and the factory started to fail. He decided to have a look in the cavern underneath the factory and he came upon a well carved cave with a small cave man. He told him, "Come play with me, I want to show you a new way of life." Robert kept working and digging until it was discovered that they were digging into an old natural spring
