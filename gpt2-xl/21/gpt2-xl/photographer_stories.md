The Story of America's Most Beautiful City". No, that wasn't quite right, because he didn't actually take a bunch of black-and-white photos of ordinary people. George Strayhorn had a bunch of black-and-white photos of ordinary people and then made them into a black-and-white book of ordinary people. That book sold very well, but he couldn't find a white guy with a camera to do the rest of the work. So he hired a black guy to do all the work. That's how Dune was born.

In addition to actually taking photos of everyday people, George Strayhorn employed a few other freelance photojournalistic colleagues to do the actual editing of the pictures. The rest of Dune's creative staff (if there's a staff at all) were men who had jobs. And by jobs, I mean "gadgets", because, in this universe, photography wasn't a profession.
