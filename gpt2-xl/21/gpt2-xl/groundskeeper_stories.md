Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Dave Smith who worked at the All-America Camp, the prestigious spring camp that every team sends their top highschool recruits to. Dave had always dreamed of being a college coach but he really couldn't figure out how to get there. He had two daughters but there was really no way he was going to give up his love for coaching. Dave turned to beer sales and it got him a job working two summers at a brewpub in the small town of New Town. After a year of doing a great job, Dave was ready to move to a big program and get good at the sales job. The school had a scholarship program for underclassmen and Dave ended up getting the job after some good contacts on the staff. Once you have gotten under his skin he knows exactly what to say. Some players try to impress him, but Dave just wants money.


"Hey man, tell me about yourself,"Dave said.


"Dave, I'm the only one of the boys who has ever played in college. I played for West Virginia and they won a national title. I did not win a ballgame but I am just an underclassman with no chance of winning anything. I just want to go to school and try to make something of my life."


"Great, you are the type of recruit that would make me very happy for the rest of the year, but I have something else for you."
