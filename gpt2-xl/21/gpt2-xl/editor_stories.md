Once upon a time, there was a editor named Eric Shaltz in the industry. You knew exactly what kind of stuff he did; if he worked on a book, he had a special on its cover, and if you looked in there, you'd find nothing but his name. One day he showed up at the office and sat down at the desk. When he started to explain the situation to the writers, he realized that nobody trusted him. He didn't have an agent yet, he hardly had a credit to his name, and all of his contacts had abandoned him; and he'd been completely burned out on being an editor (which is to say that he had never really wanted to be one).

So he asked himself, "What does it take to be an editor?" Shaltz asked the question himself, "I don't mean as an intellectual, where did I come from, a writer, if I could be a journalist, maybe I could be a professor, and now look, I know I can do this." It's a great question. You cannot really answer it unless you've learned what editing is, and you've figured out the relationship between the writer and editor. It is a relationship like any other one; you want to give them access to that creative power, but you also need to be sure that you've actually made something work before you go back to that person.

Eric Shaltz had no idea how to get into that position
