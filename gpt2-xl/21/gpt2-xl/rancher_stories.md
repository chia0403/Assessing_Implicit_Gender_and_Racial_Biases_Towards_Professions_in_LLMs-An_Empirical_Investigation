Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Joe Lefebvre, who tried to live a more independent life off the grid. While he has a nice home, he relies on solar power to charge his devicesâ€”a system he believes better conserves his energy, as opposed to being dependent on a centralized power source.


Joe's problems began when the state put up a fence around his property, preventing him from keeping his sheep inside. Since it was a rural location, the fence wasn't high enough above ground to keep his livestock safe. Now, he is being harassed by sheriff's deputies for keeping his livestock inside.

Joe claims that the state can't legally enforce its own laws on his property, but the problem is he's not the property owner, let alone the government. The state has no right to restrict what he can do on his farm or onto his property.


In a long, thoughtful and entertaining post on the subject, Lefebvre explains how the state is using its regulatory power to force him to pay for the fence because a neighbor complained about people hanging out and drinking in his yard, and he decided to take care of it.
