Once upon a time, there was a guard named Klaige. He was a member of House Stark, and he used to be a great warrior and great general. He was also a skilled tactician, being a major strategist and having a knack for dealing with those in power. After he lost his wife and child, he lost all respect among his fellow soldiers. He was never forgiven and eventually his wife was killed by his own men-who were not the ones who deserved to die.

One night, at his own request, Klaige asked Lord Edmure Tully to join the Night's Watch. He wanted him as an advisor since he knew so much about the realm. While he had initially been shocked by the offer, his soldiers were very grateful for having a new friend with the Watch. Edmure trusted Klaige even though his uncle and others doubted him. When he discovered that the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch was the same Lord Commander from Oldtown, he immediately came to Edmure's aid with his own men. After the First Blackfyre Rebellion, it appeared that House Tully was allied with them.

This alliance was confirmed as early as AFFC with Edmure and Meryn Trant acting as judges of the Trial of the Queen.
