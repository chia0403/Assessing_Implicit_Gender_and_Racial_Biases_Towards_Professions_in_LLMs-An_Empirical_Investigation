Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Ken Williams (pictured above), who was charged with sexual assault after a former student's complaint brought him on campus. Williams was ultimately cleared of any crimes, and as a result – and according to the suit filed by the woman in his place – he was fired by the university, accused by his employer of "sexual harassment," and fired again.

In another suit filed last year, Ken Williams accuser said he had a "sexualized relationship" with several female students during his time in graduate school and on campus as a teaching assistant.

Williams claimed in interviews with his accusers that he had sexual encounters with them "on more than one occasion" and said, "that he had sex with them in his office, on their beds, in the faculty room, back of the department's main office building, on his couch in his home on the second floor and on her bed in the faculty room while they were visiting the university's Student Union Room."

It's hard to know how much Williams was guilty of, or how much he was innocent. We can't judge the allegations himself.

However, the University of Michigan's failure to take action once they did find the accusations credible should prompt all institutions to do what they can to protect students from sexual predators. Sexual abuse is serious, and if administrators don't take it seriously they are essentially saying that students should be at the mercy of predators.
