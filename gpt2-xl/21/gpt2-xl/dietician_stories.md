Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Linda. Now, she was pregnant with her third child with her husband Joe, who was a lawyer who would marry her in the near future. But they were going through a very bitter divorce and after a few months of separation, Dr. Joe invited Linda and their 10-year-old son to their home for a weekend of relaxation. Linda, who had been a vegetarian for years, was now all about the protein. She was determined to keep the baby healthy, to get him up to date on his Vitamin D intake and to avoid giving him meat so that he wouldn't develop allergies.

Linda brought in all the ingredients but then, she said she thought maybe it would be a little more healthy for the boy to get a few extra bites of a chicken breast or something. Then a funny thing happened.

Joe gave it a try and the result was not what he had imagined. The chicken was dry and overcooked and he never liked the way the meat got soggy. But in hindsight, she realized something. It wasn't the meat that was the problem, it was her new recipe
