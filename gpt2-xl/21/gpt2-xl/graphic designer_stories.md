Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Ben Sperling…

"I have been a graphic designer all my life, starting my career at a computer store, and in college at a graphic arts school."


"So…this was back in the day? In college? I just can't remember when."

"Well, around the release of the original Star Wars."

"I think the original Star Wars, you mean? Yeah, no…I mean, you know, my girlfriend is really into the original Star Wars, but I am not…we've been married a while and don't always watch everything together…"

"Then what movie are we talking about? The Empire Strikes Back?" The Empire Strikes Back? You've seen The Empire Strikes Back?"


"No, this is really good." She paused, considering this. "How was that?"

It's no secret that The Empire Strikes Back has a reputation for being a hard movie to love.

"Actually…I have always been a huge fan of the original Star Wars. I still am. It just wasn't released at the time I was a graphic designer."

"Well, I'm glad you don't watch Empire Strikes back to back with me."

The couple laughed and started discussing The Empire Strikes Back.

After that first date, things went from awkward awkwardly to blissfully platonic. They planned for a romantic weekend away
