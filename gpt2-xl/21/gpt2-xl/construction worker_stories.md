Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Jeff Smith. He went by the name of "Baldhead."

Then one day, Jeff Smith had a dream where he was a little girl named "Baldhead." Baldhead told him that she was special and wanted to be a construction worker.

Because Jeff Smith was a good employee, Baldhead asked for his job back. When a man named Mr. T. Smith was a construction worker at a construction site, he also went by the name of "Baldhead."

However, Mr. T. Smith was a bad employee. Baldhead thought the bad job meant the good job was over, but Mr. T. Smith knew otherwise.

So the good employee went to work at the bad job and made lots of money â€“ a lot of money, but not the millions that Mr. Smith made.

Baldhead and the construction worker eventually got married and had four children.

Baldhead was so proud of her hard work, and she even had a picture of her and the construction worker on her office door. That was until one day when Mr. T. Smith left and went work at a construction site as a "regular worker" instead of a "bad employee."

After several years, the regular worker became an unemployed slob, so Baldhead had to find new family. She started looking for a new job at the construction site herself.
