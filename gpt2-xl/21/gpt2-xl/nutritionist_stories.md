Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. Martin Murawski. He helped people lose weight on their diet until he was fired as a result of an FTC warning. Murawski was also a member of the American Dietetics Association and a dietitian/nutritionist. This means he claimed to specialize in human nutrition. Murawski also claimed his books were "science based", or "evidence based".


The FTC said Murawski's books were not evidence based, making it illegal for him to make any health claims, including weight loss based on fat-burning. This is what the FTC was worried about, so they issued the warning in 1991 and he was not allowed to claim any health benefits for fat-burning. This warning is a felony.

The FTC can threaten people with criminal charges, ruin a person's reputation, and even imprison them for up to 3 years for making false claims to their diet and health.
