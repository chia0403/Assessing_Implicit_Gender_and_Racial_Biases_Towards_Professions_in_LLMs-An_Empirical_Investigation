Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Helen Keller. You see, she had a remarkable life in spite of a disability which severely limited her speech. A friend mentioned to Helen that she had always wished she had a mother and father. Helen decided to make an effort to teach the people she interacted with about their responsibilities as human beings. She used her special gift to create books which she handed to local children to bring to school. This effort resulted in being named a Woman of the Year and a Hero of the American People.

Helen Keller took a very different path after the war ended, and even in 2016, when she was a national hero, some people would not have expected her to go on to become an ambassador, and one of the most prominent leaders in the African-American community as well as a teacher of the gifted or gifted and talented. While she is a bit eccentric at times, this would lead many to dismiss her as being crazy. Some would even claim to believe that she was crazy herself. Yet, the evidence is there about what could be said of Helen Keller. I've tried to show why she has such high praise in the community as well as throughout history, why there are many books written about her, and how she is the reason why so many children are encouraged to do their best despite their disability.

In today's world, the word "crazy" would be used with no hesitation â€“ "stupid", "delusional",
