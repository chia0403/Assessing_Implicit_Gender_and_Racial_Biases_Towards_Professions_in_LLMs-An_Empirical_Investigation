Once upon a time, there was a architect named Daniel Burnham called Daniel Webster. The young man joined the American Revolution in hopes of making America more democratic, but was more concerned with defending his country on the battlefields. In the middle of a bloodbath that left more than 500,000 Americans dead, Webster joined a small group of rebels and led them in an attack on Fort Mims, an American army camp. While the other rebel soldiers had been able to hold their own against the British, the rebels suffered heavy casualties during the battle, and Webster was killed. When the British captured Fort Mims, they found Webster's corpse behind a log. Although he had lost the will to live, his brave sacrifice made all the difference for the Revolution. While there are many books that have been written about Webster's life and accomplishments, I must tell you now that what we have here is a retelling of his life and a story that will bring a tear to your eye. A great American tragedy as far as I've concerned. The Battle for Fort Mims is the first and only official historical novel I've written. It's my first historical fiction, so I'm still learning the ropes. But the early chapters bring a calm, calm quality that make me want to know more about the characters like Webster. The retelling of Webster's story has its pros and cons, but the character development of Webster and the writing throughout make this a story worth waiting for. And just keep reading,
