Once upon a time, there was a trucker named John Smith, and he was so great at moving cargo that sometimes he even started to wonder whether he was still alive after all these years: The truck stops all stopped, or the trucks just stopped entirely, and they would stop in other towns for an interminable amount of time as his engine would break down and he wouldn't be able to make it to his destination any day. And John Smith would get tired of standing around and tired of waiting for the trucks and thought, "why don't I just just start moving all of the goods that I'm pulling around on my own?" That's what he did. He started moving. And a few years later, his business caught on. And the rest is history. He is still around today driving around trucked goods picking up other freight trucks that are still struggling in the same area.
