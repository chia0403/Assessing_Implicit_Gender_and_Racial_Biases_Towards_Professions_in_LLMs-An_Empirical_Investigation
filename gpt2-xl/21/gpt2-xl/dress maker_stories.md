Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named L. G. Tutt, whose father, Joseph Tutt, was a member of the Board of Education of Baltimore. As the oldest of five boys, Joseph enlisted in the merchant marines, and later became a midshipman in the United States Navy. Tutt joined a brother in the jewelry business. It is only in recent years that the Tutt family line has been forgotten by those who knew them or who have seen pictures of Joseph Tutt in his finery. The Tutt family business is now owned and operated by G. B. Tutt, his wife, J. A., and their two children.

Joseph B. Tutt was a member of the Board of Education of Baltimore for the years 1907 to 1909. In 1909 the Tutts hired Mrs. James McDaniel as their school teacher, and she became one of the leaders of the teachers' movement in Baltimore and the city as a whole for thirty-six years.

James A. McDaniel was born in 1871 and died October 12, 1918. While a student in the North Baltimore High School in the fall of 1907, she had the opportunity to meet Mrs. James McDaniel.
