Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Frankenstein who would cure patients with his hands. You know, just a regular ol' doctor, working for a mad doctor, who, if people's hearts died, that was his job to help out and make sure that they weren't a little bit killed. In this little case, a boy, I think his name was Franky, the boy, that died to make him a doctor.

Now, because I'm a pretty good listener, in particular, I was able to pick up the clues and figure out what was going on on the page.

D: And we have a really funny moment, very early on, where Dr. Frankenstein begins to reveal some big plot twist, you know, because he's telling the story, and, oh, no, he's dying, he's dying this time.

And, my friends, I am in awe of your genius for figuring out spoilers. And even though I did not anticipate, I saw this on the back of the book and I knew right away that the big twist was going to happen some day.

Q: You are the best.

D: Thank you. That is very touching.

It seems kind of early on, he's kind of figuring this out, and he's like, "Well, we've got to do this," and he's being the most, the most selfish
