Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Richard W. Friedman. In 1976, as a professor of Psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, Friedman had his own work published in the field of forensic psychology: The Forensic Approach to Identify, Defend, and Prosecute People. This controversial study proposed that certain traits could be measured by tests designed to identify particular behaviors. For example, if one was a rapist, one could have a series of personality tests designed to measure tendencies toward aggression, impulsivity, and psychopathic tendencies (the latter two qualities being characterized as being more common or strong in offenders). If one committed forgery, one could also have personality tests to measure forgery-the tendency to distort or forgery documents through an inability to distinguish between what is actually what and what is intended to be something else. Each test would give the subject a weighting in the desired direction or another "score."

In the context of the forensic area, the study was a landmark. Friedman argued the following:

It is possible to assess both characteristics for individual offenders and to predict potential offenders in all likelihood. In fact the tests can predict potential offenders in general because they reveal characteristics peculiar to an offender group.

In other words, the test's findings were not merely helpful to the investigator. They indicated a characteristic about an offender's underlying behavior, or behavioral pattern, that was likely to be predictive of criminal behavior. It should be noted that the
