Once upon a time, there was a logger named Bob who, while a logger, knew his way around the forest, and was a good boy. One summer day Bob left camp to go for an early morning walk. The logger was an experienced woodsman, and a fine and reliable runner. As he took his first couple of steps out of camp, Bob could already hear the trees cracking and snapping. The sound of them sounded strangely familiar to Bob, as though the woods around him had never quite been silent. From the sounds he was hearing, it seemed like the forest of the past had come back, and Bob had somehow gotten lost in it. Bob had no idea how he had gotten away from camp, nor what he had come back to. He was a good boy: he had nothing to hide, and as luck would have it, there wasn't anybody around to see him.

Once back home, Bob was puzzled about how he had gotten back to his camp, and he didn't believe it could be done. He began to ponder the possibility of being lost. Then he remembered that he worked in a lumberyard, and so he searched around for a log. After he was done with it, he went into a nearby building for some lumber. After checking to see if anyone was in the building, Bob got back into his truck to drive off. As he drove off, he began to hear different sounds. Some kind of shuffling noise, and the wood cracking again
