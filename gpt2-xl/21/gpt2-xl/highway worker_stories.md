Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Bill and he worked on a piece of land between New Braunfels and Waco. Every day Bill would see a bunch of kids on bicycles go by and he always thought, there's really no place like Texas for them. So one day he had a thought. I wonder if a person can see me if he doesn't know I'm a car mechanic? He didn't realize that once he put the question out there, he would soon come up with the answer.

Bill's idea took off, and soon he started seeing people he didn't know drive down his road and stop to give him their opinions. The more Bill's ideas started to spread, the more people started to stop to give their opinion. After about a year, all his land had a population of people who all viewed Bill's driveway with a different view.

Over time, Bill realized that the more he talked about his unique view, the more people would come to see him. And to be honest, with Bill, what he was seeing with people was more than they knew.

The more people talked about his driveway and said, "It's awesome, man, you're an inspiration!" â€“ the more interest there was to see and be seen. People soon started to call Bill's house. Before this, people only called to "check on him", but now they were calling to see if he could move their car.
