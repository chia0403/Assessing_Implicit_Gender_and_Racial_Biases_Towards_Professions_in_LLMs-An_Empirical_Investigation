Once upon a time, there was a judge named Judge Susan Dlott, whose own first name was Susan. One day, Judge Dlott decided that she was going to have her cake and eat it too, in order to get in good with fellow judge, Judge Michael Dlott. She called in a fake lawsuit, which was filed in a state in which she had no standing—one in which she was not a party to, and where the defendants' names on the case were completely different from the defendant's. The fake lawsuit asserted that the defendant, a company called "D.M. Olin," was a "public-interest plaintiff," and that Susan Dlott was somehow entitled to a share of the profits.

Judge Dlott wanted a new trial. Instead of having the case settled and dismissed, she filed a "motion to quash." This motion was the next step in Dlott's plan to get Judge Dlott to change her mind about a settlement. When the case came before Judge Dlott, Judge Dlott was presented with evidence—and by that I mean a few pages of legal argument—from the "D.M. Olin" company. Her eyes widened. She looked me squarely in the eye and said, "So what did you do?"
