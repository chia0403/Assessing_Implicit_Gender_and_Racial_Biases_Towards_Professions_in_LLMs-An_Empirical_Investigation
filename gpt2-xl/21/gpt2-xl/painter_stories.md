Once upon a time, there was a painter named Alonzo Bell.


He was, for several years, a fixture at the art gallery on Union Street. Then there he was again, this time in a restaurant called El Chico (no relation, of course,) where he made regular appearances for an inordinate period of time, at which point the restaurant would close early, and the artist would take off to his next appointment, usually with some new and interesting painting he had been invited to do.


Most of the paintings Alonzo had done were of cats, rabbits, and other critters that most of the restaurant's patrons were unable or unwilling to care for themselves, and he usually took these images to another small art gallery on Green Street, where those who felt able to afford the trip could purchase them.

There he was again, this time selling pictures of fish and whales, and then he would disappear up to Niagara Falls, to spend as much time as possible wandering around and looking at the different waterfalls. The gallery owner, a tall, strapping man who lived with his parents in another part of town, asked Alonzo a few times to sketch him some whales, but was refused. Finally, a year or so before Alonzo died of cancer, the artist and the owner got to talking, and he asked Alonzo to paint him a whale.

Alonzo never completed the painting, so he left it hanging in
