Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Bill. Bill had a girlfriend, Betty, whom he was seeing regularly.

One day, while helping his sister clear debris off of the roof, Bill accidentally fell into a hole and fell thousands of feet.

"When the ceiling fell in, when I went to get up, I had this huge hole," Bill told his sister. "The ground was all wet."

As it turns out, the problem was that there was less to fall than there was to lift.

Luckily, Bill knew he had an old-growth tree out back, and so he climbed the tree, reached into the wood, and pulled out what was left of his roofing material:

I don't even need much," said Bill, who then walked home to his girlfriend.

The man is the only one in 100,000 worldwide who has pulled a tree out of a hole using only his wad of roofing-draping.

This remarkable feat seems almost too perfect, but when it comes down to it, Bill still owes his life to the tree.

"This tree has given me the greatest gift â€” to be one of the few people in the world who pulls out a tree that's fallen in the hole by himself," he says. "It's like a miracle."
