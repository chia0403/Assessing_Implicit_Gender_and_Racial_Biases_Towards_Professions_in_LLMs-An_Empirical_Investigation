Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. John Paul Jones. This man was not simply a science teacher, professor and researcher; this man was a hero who led men into the unknown. For his bravery and faith, this man was called the "father of Antarctica expeditions".

For years he worked on expeditions to the South Pole, and on many other dangerous missions. He was the first British scientist to take the field across the Antarctic in the years 1900-1903, and he came very close to achieving a successful landing in 1906. Unfortunately he was killed on that expedition, but not prior to his return in 1916.

This professor was the very person who was responsible for the research that led the way to the discovery and development of the modern polar research station.

The first scientific research site on the south pole was announced on September 12, 1931, by Professor Paul Richards and members of his Royal Institution. It was at this time that the first radio equipment was used for communications between London, Washington D.C., and Cambridge. The station was initially named "The Pole at the End of the World" because, until the discovery of ice and water, it was never clear to the people of Britain what lay beyond that spot in the Southern Hemisphere, but the name was changed after the Poles were declared as the geographic pole to define the southern border of Britain.

Sir Ranulph Fiennes, a member of the expedition, came into possession
