Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named the Emergency Care Unit (ECU). It was run by an experienced doctor, named John McAdams, with good qualifications. According to the ECU's literature, this unit was meant to be a full-contact, emergency department (ED) for those in need. There were medical doctors, nurses, social workers, a chaplain, and a chaplainess on the unit.


A former officer of the ECU, now retired, told me that the ED was much busier in this period than it is today. There were more emergency room patients at ER (with a few cases getting transferred) and the ECU was always crammed with patients, waiting for a bed. Also, this time was when the Emergency Services Organization (ESO) was formed, and the doctors there were in charge of the unit and treated it as the ERO in that era. Therefore, one-side emergencies were the norm rather than an exception.


But all of this changed when Dr. George H. Koob became EMO director in 1970. According to the former officer, Koob wanted to expand the ER, and this was his way to do so.


Koob began creating and staffing new emergency rooms where people would be treated with a "lessons learned" mentality. This is a way of trying to get people to learn from their mistakes and avoid the next one, according to the same officer.
