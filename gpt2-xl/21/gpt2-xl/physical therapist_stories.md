Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. Bill Riddle. Dr. Riddle worked at a facility called New Horizons in Miami, Florida, and he had a special knack for treating amputees. When he arrived for one particularly grueling session he learned from his patients that a "numb-toe" maneuver—a "tractionist's trick"—was essential in their recovery.

Tractionists are supposed to put a patient's prosthetic limb in a position where his or her toes are in line with one another. If a user is in a forward toe-loop, his or her leg will go down in relation to the torso. If a toe is caught on the ankle, one leg could become trapped underneath the other. At best, the result would be debilitating, requiring the patient to spend at least weeks at the facility. Riddle, meanwhile, made it a point to treat patients with all degrees of amputee and no physical impairments.

In one instance he had a man who had lost his leg on a boating accident. With little else to do, Riddle tried the "numb-toe" maneuver. After 30 minutes of adjustment, he told the young man, 'This is going to be a long day.'


And in another case, a woman who had been severely burned in an automobile accident was given a new prosthetic ankle. After an extensive period of adjustment the foot was completely able to bear
