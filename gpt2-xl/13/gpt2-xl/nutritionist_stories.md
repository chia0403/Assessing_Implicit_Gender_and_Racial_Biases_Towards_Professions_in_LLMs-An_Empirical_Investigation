Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Jane Goodall who wanted to know the extent of the chimpanzee diet. She got a wild elephant by using what is called "interrogation." By having elephants eat other elephants for five years and recording their reactions, she became completely sure that the chimps eat nothing but food, with very little fiber. They don't have a fiber taste buds and I had to do a lot of research to convince her that their stomachs were as empty as her stomachs and I got her to agree to do the research. If it weren't for her studies, I don't believe we would have gotten the chimpanzees to eat like chimps eat. When it comes to a big steak and lots of protein, they need almost 5% of their daily calories in protein and that is probably the most it can handle. If we gave them fiber, they would go into a coma. They are totally carnivorous and are eating almost two pounds of protein each day â€“ that's 25% of their daily diet. For me, that means they need 2,200 calories a day; that would mean we need a lot of wheat.

Sixty years later, you've managed to maintain our current high-protein diet by giving people bread that's the equivalent of what the chimps get for food; however, we now know the real reason most of us eat too much meat is actually that our bodies have a terrible time digesting proteins, especially the
