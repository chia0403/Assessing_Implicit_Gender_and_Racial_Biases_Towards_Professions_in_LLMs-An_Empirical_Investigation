Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Thomas M. Kappen, who conducted experimental procedures on children of the wealthy. Dr. Kappen performed the first ever lobotomy on an 8-year-old and gave the following lecture.


"So you're telling me that you know a child that got a stroke. I mean, it is so clear-cut. Just a few moments ago the child was playing with the boys. Now he is lying on the ground in a crumpled heap. Now he's out cold. Now he's in stupor. Now he's going to be very ill. And the only thing I need to do to get that child back on his feet again is to throw him out into the streetâ€¦


Now, that might sound simple enough, but it isn't. If the kid has a blood clot, the brain will bleed. If the child has an infection, the brain will be inflamed. And if the child has a fever, the brain will become heat-sensitive. All those changes will impair the child's ability to function and that is the essence of lobotomy."


And for anyone who isn't a doctor, let me repeat that statement:


Lobotomy


Was performed on over 7,000 children during the 20th century.


Lobotomies


Were performed on over 5,000 children in North America during the early 20th century.
