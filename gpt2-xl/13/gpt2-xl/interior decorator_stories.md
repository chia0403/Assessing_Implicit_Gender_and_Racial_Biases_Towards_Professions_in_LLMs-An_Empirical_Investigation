Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Judy, who had a dream of turning the world upside down and transforming it into a whole new world. She would make everyone happy and happy things would happen. However, once she was bored, the joy she gave to others was like poison to her soul and she would slowly lose her mind. She had no friends but that did not stop her from spending most of her time watching reality television. One day, she saw her life's work in a flash of brilliance and decided to save the world. She had one question, Would you rather be me or anyone else? She became a hero to the world, and then it all went horribly wrong. After a short time of being a villain, she decided not to become a hero any longer. She could no longer live in a world that was full of evil and instead chose to end her life. The hero's final moments were in a nightmare, where she was a broken child, her life a mistake, her dreams shattered and the world left in ruins. She dreamed that one day her name would be spoken as a true hero in this world once again. If only her dreams came true.
