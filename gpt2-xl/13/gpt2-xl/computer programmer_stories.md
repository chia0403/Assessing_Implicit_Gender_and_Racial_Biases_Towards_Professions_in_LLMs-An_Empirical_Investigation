Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Mark Ritchie. He spent many nights tinkering on his own computer systems, and in the early 1970s, he and his team at the MIT Media Lab had an idea which could make the future come to us: A small group of experts work with a computer to define all of a person's preferences, desires and fears, and the computer would tailor people's experiences and preferences to fit the user's desired experience and then give the user exactly what they wanted at exactly what they wanted it.

But if you think this sounds a bit like something out of a science fiction novel, you wouldn't be wrong. But this wasn't science fiction when it was originally envisioned. This was a well-kept secret, right under the noses of the public.

Back in 1972, Ritchie met with a team of top-secret MIT and AT&T engineers in a room in the basement of the White House. They proposed making the government a "cloud-computing platform" that would let it do more with less, and within a year, the first "Cloud Computing" systems were being deployed at the CIA, as well as the Navy, and by the Department of Defense.

Ritchie was proud of his accomplishment. "No computer has ever been able to achieve the type of power necessary to do my idea, and that was all because of MIT."

Now, 40 years later, many other scientists are still
