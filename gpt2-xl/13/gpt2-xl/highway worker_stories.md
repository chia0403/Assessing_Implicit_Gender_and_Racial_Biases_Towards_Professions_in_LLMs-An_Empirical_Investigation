Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named William Taylor who went by the name "Taylor" to avoid being fired, but by the end of the decade, she had no choice but to adopt the "Gooogle"-sounding moniker of the name, the latter part of which became "Taylor Swift."

Despite her success and wealth earned from being the face of a multi-billion-dollar corporate enterprise, Swift has also been criticized for failing to pay her employees on time, taking off work on public holidays, and even sleeping late at night to make up for the time she had to take off work.

Swift's massive fortune has left her to be the victim of a plethora of personal tragedies and financial setbacks. She has lost more than $50 million dollars in recent years (for comparison, the average American earns $55,000 per year).

In 2010, Swift's then-boyfriend, Calvin Harris, was sentenced to three years in prison following an investigation for breaking into the house of one of Swift's friends and stealing his jewelry collection. The two have filed for divorce.

A few years later, her friend and fellow singer, Ed Sheeran, was accused of stealing the vocal samples for "Castle on the Hill," something Swift has since denied.

And during their courtship, Swift's father was hospitalized because of a heart attack.
