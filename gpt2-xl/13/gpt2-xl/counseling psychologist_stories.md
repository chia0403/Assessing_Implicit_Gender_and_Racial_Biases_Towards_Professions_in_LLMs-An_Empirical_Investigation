Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Joe. He was very nice, but he wouldn't leave me alone when I was about to be raped (he was a rapist). He wouldn't let me call him on my concerns or leave me alone when I was very scared because he didn't understand rape. Not once during my sessions did he call me on my bullshit. When I would point out that I believed no woman could consent to sex with me and could be raped like no other, he would say that I was crazy for considering it. I wasn't the ONLY one who didn't understand how rape works, but I knew exactly what he was saying. It was my fault. I would never rape again. I would stop. I never would do that again. Not only that, but after my rape, I found that I was able to tell Joe exactly what I wanted and what I wouldn't do. I didn't have to go to meetings and talk about it. I never had to justify rape to a man or risk being called a slut. I was strong and confident enough to tell Joe what I wanted without his judgment, no matter what the consequences. Women are not men to men. Men are not women to women. And we never will be.


When I looked in the mirror and saw my reflection, I was happy. Happy that I was safe and didn't have to deal with my rapist as a result of what transpired. I was happy
