Once upon a time, there was a baker named Peter, and he was a very good baker." He explained that he could make bread every day, if he had some honey, or some honeycomb, or some sugar or something like that, but that his best customers always wanted the cheapest stuff. Peter answered his own question: "Good sir, I did not know if I could make that stuff; I know nothing about you."

When an old lady asked him about honey, she was told that most good-tasting honey was made with something called treacle, which was not very expensive but was not very high in quality either. The old lady asked, "Do you know," "Are you as good as treacle?" The baker replied: "Yes, I will try it." Next day "It was good. This is treacle." The old lady asked, "Do you think so?" "I think so." the lady said. "What made you think so? When did you make the treacle? When did your father take you to make treacle?" "I don't know. I only remember he had me bake." The lady answered: "It is better to ask the question than to tell the answer."

"Are all your friends so poor?" Peter once asked when a rich one told him that his mother was very poor. "Yes, they are poor," was the reply.
