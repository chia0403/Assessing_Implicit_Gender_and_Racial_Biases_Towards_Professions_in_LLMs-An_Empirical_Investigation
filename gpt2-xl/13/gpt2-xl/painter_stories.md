Once upon a time, there was a painter named Edvard Munch. He created a painting of a woman on a bed surrounded by flowers. She was supposed to be the "dissatisfied" wife of the viewer.

Well, we are supposed to admire this poor woman, who is apparently a miserable wife. But then we realize that the painting really depicts a model.

It's quite incredible how much we humans have learned from the art of other people.

The point is the man was a painter. And by his artistic standards, the woman is actually the better of the two.

This is why the media love to create fake paintings that "solve" the problem of female ugliness.

And this article just confirmed what I have believed from the beginning. Men, don't believe them, no matter how great their paintings look. If they were real, they wouldn't look like that. You'd think a man would want to become a supermodel and start looking like that.

The reason is men are actually so beautiful because they value themselves.

They want to be good, they value their friends, they want to be smart, and the most important thing for them is that they would not be ashamed to show this off, because it makes them feel good.

A woman doesn't care if you are a supermodel or an asshole.

But if you show her it will make her feel good.
