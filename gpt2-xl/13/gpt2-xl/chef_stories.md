Once upon a time, there was a chef named Daniel that loved cooking. What would the future have been like as Daniel cooked and his creations were passed down from father to son (not that there was much competition if you're reading this blog). Daniel was also an inventor and was the first to claim himself an inventor and thus inventor king (or, if you prefer, president). When Daniel's son Daniel Jr. decided to become a lawyer, it was Daniel Sr. that took over the mantle of being the king and in doing so became known as the greatest inventor since Thomas Edison.

One of the most important inventions that came out of George Washington University in the 200s was that of the DC bus. One of the more well-known characters of DC was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney. Taney was also an expert in the field of jurisprudence. One of the greatest pieces of literature in the early 2000s was DC in Black and White by John Grisham. In this book, Grisham portrays Taney during his term as Chief Justice. After the tragic murder of Taney's wife in 1876, Taney became the head of DC's judicial system. One of the things that he did that was notable was to issue a ruling that all African Americans in D.C. were property and therefore, the property of whites. This ruling was later modified, however, and Taney's rule that is is still in place today
