I don't know this judge very well. Maybe he was a Democrat, or a centrist Democrat?

I just know that he voted against my requests. I didn't care much for him, really. He didn't seem like he was a particularly nice person. I figured he must be a Republican. He voted for my tax cuts, which were on the House floor right then. He voted for repealing the Affordable Care Act. He voted for giving the President authority to increase the debt ceiling. He voted for cutting unemployment insurance.
