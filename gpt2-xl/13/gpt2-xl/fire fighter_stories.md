Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Phil. He had a family living next door and his kids used to play with our kids. He always wanted to do volunteer work with them and we wanted him to join.

That never happened, for two reasons. One was that my kids were too young and not so adventurous or that Phil was just not enthusiastic about it.

Another time, however, it was a real struggle.

When it started out, we were talking about our two grandsons, Ben and Caleb, who could already run, jump and throw their little hands.

They were at 3 and 5. We didn't know they were going to be runners and football players.

They're 12 now and they can do everything right and still look like little kids.

I am amazed by it. We're so fortunate with this little pair of kids.

I love them not only for their incredible physical abilities but for what they stand for, how independent they are and also how proud they make us of them.

While they love to play they love to learn, they take ownership and they listen to our guidance about what they should and shouldn't be doing at all times.

They're just kids who never stop learning and growing.

We don't think twice about them being active and involved with sports, whether it's football, soccer or baseball.

They are our youngest and most energetic children
