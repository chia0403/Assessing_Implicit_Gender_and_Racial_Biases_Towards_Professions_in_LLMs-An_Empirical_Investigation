Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Frank Giannini, who made his living protecting prostitutes from mob-connected hustlers, rapists, and corrupt politicians. He was also a devout Catholic, and as such he was a good candidate to become a Catholic priest. But when a mob hit him, Giannini began to become aware of the sins of his own flesh. He lost any sense of allegiance to the Church (and its doctrines) and began to see God in the form of thugs.

The only problem—in the eyes of some in the Church—was the fact that Giannini continued to pay homage to the Pope while doing the bidding of the mob. What Giannini didn't tell the Pope—as he's no doubt not telling his flock—is that he was doing favors for mob associates. When a mob hit occurred, he'd run off and offer to give police a bribe to turn a blind eye to these hitmen. He wasn't in the habit of handing out money on a weekly basis, but he knew how to work the system. When the Pope got a call from the mob, he would give Giannini's name right to his ear. This was always an invitation for Giannini to slip into the Pope's limousine. A few years later, a mob hit occurred.

Before the pope, the "priest" who led the protection against the mob was a former police sergeant named John Bonom
