Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Bill Sweeny. He had very thick eyebrows, which he often wore in a bun. He liked to draw pictures that were all connected, and he was very creative in his drawings. One time, he discovered that there was no picture in nature that did not have a friend. This friend was a river that flowed west to east and was almost always covered in rain. At first he thought it was a nice picture because it is simple, and he found that it very clearly showed an association between all the rivers in his town. He had drawn many examples of rivers in many of his drawings, and they were very often made of a sort of rope, for they were made from sticks or tree rings.

One day, the very handsome man who ran the library and the man who often helped Bill with his drawings decided that they would make a drawing. They drew a line down the middle of a small circle, and they said to Bill, "Now if you just draw a line from the river to the mountain and then cut off that line, the mountains will fill in the circle." Bill thought this would be very difficult, but he had learned drawing and could quickly turn the lines into perfect circles. He did so and then asked, "What is this drawing that we have done?" The man said, "Oh Bill! It is a representation of the mountain. It is just a representation of a mountain with a circle on top
