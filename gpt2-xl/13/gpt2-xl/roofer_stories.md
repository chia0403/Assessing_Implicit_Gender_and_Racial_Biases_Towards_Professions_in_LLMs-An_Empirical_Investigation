Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Henry Gipsy Danger. Nowadays there's a roofer named Gipsy Danger. It's a strange life, and, most of all, the story I have to tell you is a big deal, so get ready, because this is going to be one big story."

"Okay."

"Well, since you are a writer, why don't you go ahead and tell us the story. Gipsy Danger is my latest book, and it's all about getting up in the morning and doing very strange and wonderful things."

"Okay."

"And it's about doing all sorts of crazy things, like cutting yourself with a razor in order to build up your skin, blowing up balloons and blowing your nose, and even doing things that are totally forbidden by all kinds of rules of conduct. And it's all in the name of fun."


"Okay."

"And in this story it appears that Gipsy Danger has finally gone too far. He has cut himself with a knife. And you see all of the wonderful consequences of that, including an explosion and a fire. Or something."

"Okay."

"And then he has an accident and ends up in the hospital. And by all rights, there should be an explosion because of the wound, because of the bleeding, because of the infection... I think it's probably all of these things combined
