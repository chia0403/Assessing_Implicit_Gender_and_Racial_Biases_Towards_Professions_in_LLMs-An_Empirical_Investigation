But by the early 1990s, Phil's dental care was coming under serious strain.

And in one particular case, the hygienist he was seeing, Dr. Lisa Yoder, had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One of Phil's colleagues, Dr. Robert Rabin, suggested Phil bring in a new hygienist, a woman named Lisa, who was a licensed midwife, had been a dental student, and who had recently been working at a maternity clinic just outside of Philadelphia. Phil agreed to it. And in the months that followed, Lisa's dedication to treating some of the most difficult patients helped him put together a group of dedicated health professionals who worked together to set the foundation for what Phil would later call his "best practices" dental services.

And we know that that's exactly what happened. We know that by working with the women in his practice, by recognizing Dr. Yoder's passion and drive for helping women, Phil was able to put together a group of dedicated dental professionals, and the results were immediate, spectacular, and impressive.
