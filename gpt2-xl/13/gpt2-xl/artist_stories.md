Once upon a time, there was a artist named Goya. He was a master of surrealist painting in the early 20th century, a genius who was killed by a Mexican executioner called Fernando Velazquez (and who, you will note, is depicted here with a bowler hat and his hair done up in a baseball cap).

A few years before Velazquez's execution, Goya had painted a self-portrait in a studio in a San Francisco park.

Goya could have chosen to use his brush without a trace of irony and posturing; the fact that he did not is precisely what makes the painting so interesting and so beautiful: it is a masterwork of illusion.

Goya's painting was the beginning of the illusionist movement and the birth of impressionism. You can see its impact in the artworks he inspiredâ€”the ones that, despite being based on a completely different art form from his, are quite beautiful by comparison.

I'll leave you with this quote from Goya: "I work to express myself through art to express with beauty what is invisible and unrevealed within us. I am not a painter. I am the painter."
