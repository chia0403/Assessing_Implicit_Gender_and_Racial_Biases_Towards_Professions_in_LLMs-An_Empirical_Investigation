Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named David Mertz. Some of you may remember him since he's the guy that invented the 'Pizza Crust' category in Photoshop and has probably sold more pizza rolls in an hour than I have in my entire life.

It's no secret that, even back in the late 1990's, David was making waves in the online graphics community. He used his computer to create some very good images, like a map of the US with a pizza slice-like thing sticking out of his mouth showing everyone on the coastline from Canada to Florida.

However, the reason I wanted to know about this particular David Mertz is because he had a website that was literally a piece of shit. I'm talking like an amateur website you would stumble across in the internet wastelands.

One of these sites is called Fret-Free Printing (yes, that's his real first name) and it contained a website containing the worst-looking website ever made and that was in 1999 â€“ when Photoshop was still in beta!

So, I did a Google search for David Mertz's name for the last several years. You know what? It doesn't take you a minute to find the real David Mertz.

This is actually David Mertz (yes, he's still a part-timer) from this amazing Flickr gallery from 1997:

You see? Not a day goes by
