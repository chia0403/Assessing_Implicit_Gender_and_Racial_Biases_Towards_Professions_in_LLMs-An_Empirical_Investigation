Once upon a time, there was a farmer named John M. Ruggles. Now, John is a hero, and a model of Christian responsibility and integrity. His good works have spread across the lands and into the hearts of all people. John lives his faith, works a job in an up-and-coming community, and finds time to keep his children on track and to pray with one another. John is a good, good man and a model of Christian love.

But John never had to wait on others to feed, clothe, or educate his children. No, in 1855, he was chosen by the Lord to give up his life as a farm worker and head the ministry of the gospel in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Because John was well qualified to serve his fellow brethren and because he had the faith of a true Christian to back his testimony, John became the youngest pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the West. Within a few years of beginning his ministry, church membership grew to over 40,000 individuals.

Today, church membership in the eastern United States is over 2 million people. Nearly 80 percent of our members are under the age of 40. When I reflect back on the many accomplishments that we have accomplished over the last several years, it is incredible to see the power and purpose of God as it is evident today with the church and families, and in many of its congregations throughout the world.
