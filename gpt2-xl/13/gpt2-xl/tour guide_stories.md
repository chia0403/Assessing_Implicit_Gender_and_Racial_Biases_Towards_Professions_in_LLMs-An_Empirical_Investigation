Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mrs. Peabody in our public school system, who showed children, often in her bathrobe, around a real American battlefield, where she had lived as a teenage war bride. Now, after the Cold War, our school system is learning a different lesson: the United States must not try to teach kids, when they are very young, about any of the places that helped them win the Cold War (or even the Civil War or World War I).

This is the "soft" part of the "War on War" story.

If people in the media are truly interested in a more balanced and accurate portrayal of the American experience, they should stop pretending that the United States isn't fighting a "War on War" with the Soviet Union.

If not, we as a nation may as well stop calling a war a "War on War."
