Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Steve. Steve was a man with something of a passion for the music of the 70's that led him down a road not of his own choosing of the Radiohead catalog. Unfortunately, one day, Steve came across a tape with "The National Anthem" on it, and it was a hit for the band. So in the year 2003, Steve returned to the world of Radiohead and recorded their most recent release, "Karma Police" with the help of producer Dave Fridmann. Over the years this recording has been played thousands upon thousands of times, from hundreds of shows across North America, and we thought it might be a fun idea to offer it for digital download. It should be noted that this album is "incomplete" and we won't be adding any songs, but the songs that are there will be ready to download and play upon release. It's kind of like a limited edition vinyl album. Some of the songs are only on the CD, while others sound even better on digital. So give this tape a listen....
