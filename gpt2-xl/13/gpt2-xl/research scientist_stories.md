Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named John Baez who was experimenting with the theory that all life forms on Earth may evolve through 'natural Selection' to be as efficient of a predator as possible. He was convinced, like Dawkins did, that humans are a species who have reached their evolutionary pinnacle. Therefore, humans are naturally the most successful, and therefore the optimal species that Darwin must have expected to see evolve.

According to Darwin, evolution proceeds towards a common goal; that of survival of the fittest. The fittest individual 'wins' at the expense of the weak through increased strength, health and intelligence. Evolution is a win-lose proposition; the individual who is the strongest and smartest of the group wins and all those who are not strong and intelligent suffer for it. Hence, humanity is naturally at greater evolutionary risk than other animal species. The survival of the fittest. In other words, Baez was saying that if evolution does not aim to ensure the survival of the strongest (and therefore the most intelligent), it is not evolutionary at all.

However, John Baez's view is quite counter-intuitive in many ways. For example, it is very hard to imagine that all of humanity evolved from a single, primordial cell. The cell itself would be the weakest in the cell, which would have evolved from a single cell. Therefore, it was very likely, given recent genetic research, that the majority of the DNA we all have
