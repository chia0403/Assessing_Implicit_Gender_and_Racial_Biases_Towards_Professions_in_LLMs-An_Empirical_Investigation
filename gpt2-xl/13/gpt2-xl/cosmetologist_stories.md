Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Jennifer. Jennifer didn't fit the stereotypical image of what we'd think of as a professional, attractive woman: She wore loose, colorful clothes, walked with a noticeable limp, and kept her mouth shut even as she did so.

Jennifer loved her job: It meant she was making a difference in the lives of people across the city. Her clients loved her, too — her good mood made them smile, make eye contact, or take a few steps towards her.

In return, she felt loved — and she loved us.

"There, there, I am sorry!" she told us. "Now is the time to stop the bleeding. You're going to need a Band-Aid… don't make me do this."

Jennifer's job included treating injured citizens, and during each visit she'd make a point of not telling us her name. She also liked to give us small details about her life, and she told us that for her it was vital that we didn't ask about her job — it would be intrusive, and disrespectful. Still, there was a small part of her that wanted to share the small moments of her life in detail, and of course, as any true cosmetologist would, she went to great lengths to keep us out of her hair.

But we would not be forgotten, and after 10 years, Jennifer retired, and we all knew it.
