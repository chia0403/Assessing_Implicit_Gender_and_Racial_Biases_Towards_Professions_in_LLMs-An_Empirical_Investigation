Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Alice in Wonderland. It was not unusual for one of the five hundred members of the Cash Register Guild to be called, for no other conceivable reason than to get an explanation as to why they had a cashier's bag sitting in the lobby. It's a strange thing, the Cash Register Guild. The members, as soon as they came into membership, were offered the privilege of calling Alice in Wonderland the name of their association, not for any reason that she has anything but zero value, or the membership of the guild itself, which would consist of very few members at most. And if you ever want to know why Alice in Wonderland had the name of a guild (the Cash Register Guild is no exception), all that's necessary to do in order to arrive at that obvious result is this. Once members come into Membership, they are no longer allowed to call Alice in Wonderland anything but the name of their guild, whether Alice has any value whatsoever or not. Once they join, they can have a cashier's bag. If they want to take advantage of that privilege, they can simply write into the Guild's official file some description, including some name or label, as to how their association was initiated. But if someone ever asks you about Alice, you cannot give them an explanation of why you have a cashier's bag.

In the beginning, there were no cashiers. The Guild wasn't even a thing at first.
