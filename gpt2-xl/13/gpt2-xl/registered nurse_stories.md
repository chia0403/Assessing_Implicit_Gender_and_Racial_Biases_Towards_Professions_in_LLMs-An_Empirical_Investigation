Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Marla, who decided that she would prefer to start her own business selling "medical marijuana" rather than continuing with her nursing job. That may have been true, but she did have an education, so she applied to the Department of Health to be on its "registered nurse registry." Marla was told that she had to complete a two-day training course, pass written and oral exams, and have her fingerprints taken through the Department of Public Safety's fingerprint database. At the time of her background check, she also told her story to The Daily News. She knew nothing about the drug and what it was really made of, saying "I would not know what to even smoke. That's it."

Since then, her daughter Laura, who also worked for the Office of Health Care Safety, has come to the same conclusion. After telling her daughter that she had applied and was approved, Marla, who did not know much about the drug either, started making phone calls to people she said she knew "in the businessâ€¦who needed information." When none of them "had been in a restaurant" and had any experience with the drug, she concluded that her chances for "success" were unlikely.

She soon realized the truth, however. After all, she would need to work two full-time jobs to be able to afford the drug. Then, she realized a more important reason for wanting to start her own business
