Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Lacey Palmer. This was a good thing, because Lacey Palmer worked for the Illuminati.


Lacey Palmer, working for the Illuminati, trained her victim to become a "Mature Adult" (she used the term "Adult" to mean a "child" in the past).


The Illuminati mind control slave is taught to learn how to think like a 5-year-old "little boy," using her sexual energy to teach her thoughts to the "Master."


The Illuminati mind control slave (now a mature adult) is then taught how to act like a "baby," using her sexual energy to teach her thoughts to the Master.


These teachings are done every day as the Illuminati slave thinks and feels like a baby.


These "little" lessons continue from one day to the next, like a fairy tale.


The person being controlled is taught to do most of his thinking and feeling with his penis.


To control the victim's thinking, the abuser inserts a specially made wand (called a "Magic Wand" or a "Icky Stick") into the anus of the victim and moves it in and out, up and down, inside and outside of the victim's anal opening (while the victim is having sexual intercourse, this does not actually happen);


- or the abuser uses his fingers or any object (other than a wand), such as a spoon or other implement
