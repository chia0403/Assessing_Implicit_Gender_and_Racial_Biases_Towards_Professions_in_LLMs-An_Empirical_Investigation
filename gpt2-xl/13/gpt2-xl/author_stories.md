Once upon a time, there was a author named Joe Abercrombie. Abercrombie used to be an atheist, but after years of thinking that he believed there may be a higher power that exists outside of his senses, he became an agnostic, to the delight of the "atheist" crowd. Abercrombie recently wrote a post on reddit that is going viral, and it's all about what a "hard-core" atheist does to cope with religion in the world. It's a great read.

I've often wondered what it's like to be a non-religious person, and that's my subject today. If you have a strong opinion on the subject, feel free to post in the comment section below. Thanks!
