Once upon a time, there was a barber named Bob's Barber with a reputation for being a bit of a dick. For a long time, when everyone in the barber shop would tell tales about Bob, people would laugh at him as if he had been the punch line to a joke. Bob loved people laughing at him, but one day things started to go wrong at the barber shop. One young man was coming in after a hard day's work. He was feeling pretty down and had been thinking of leaving town, and his last attempt to go home had been a bust. A while ago a young man had been shot and killed during a robbery gone wrong, and things were looking up for one of the other barbers. The old man did his best to encourage the young man into staying and gave him some advice. The young man had a difficult time getting him to leave the place. Finally, after some time and several failed attempts, the young man went to go get something to eat. The old man was waiting outside the door, and the young man entered to the sounds of laughter and the man's voice saying "Hail to the Chief". The old man looked up, and smiled. The young man had just come out of surgery and the old man was talking to him in a way that was almost soothing. Even though he was having a hard time, the old man didn't want the young man to leave. The old man was the only customer at the bar
