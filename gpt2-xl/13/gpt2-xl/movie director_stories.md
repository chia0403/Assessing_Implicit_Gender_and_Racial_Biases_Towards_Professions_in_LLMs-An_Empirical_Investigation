Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Tom Cruise who wanted to make a movie. And at the time, studios didn't really want to open new franchises; they worried that franchises would cannibalize their revenues and they might not even make money at all. Cruise, naturally, was open to the idea, so he hired his brother, former Wall Street Journal reporter, Jon Voight, to play his protagonist. It didn't take long for the film to change to an action movie starring John Travolta. It's an old story in Hollywood - a bunch of Hollywood names get together to make a movie; a few months later, it's changed so much that every actor involved ended up looking like that dude you met for a single episode of the Twilight Zone. And once you go in for that specific role, the roles always change back to the guy you had in mind all along when you met. Sometimes, the director is the person least affected by the changes. Or maybe the director didn't realize what they were doing until after it's already been completed.
