Once upon a time, there was a professor named J.L. King, who taught at Harvard: I don't know what he teaches now. He used to teach the history of science at Harvard?

I don't know what course that was.

Yeah. Well, I've read all of his books and I think he probably still teaches them.

I didn't really know. Then I met him. He was the first scientist I asked to give me a tour of his castle and house, just because I want to know. It's amazing! It smells like a castle! He's got a lake. I was fascinated, and I started researching. I read about the castle and I went through his journals.

You read so much of the journals, like an amateur scientist!

No, not an amateur scientist.

It's a scholarly look at the history of science!

Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

You've studied his work a lot now, to be fair. Has this made you curious about the sciences as a whole, or about the sciences?

Not really!

No, it didn't make you curious.

I think it's hard to talk about science without talking about race and colonialism and economics. What has that made you interested in studying?

It's a lot easier to talk about a field of research that doesn't involve race, but the sciences in general.
