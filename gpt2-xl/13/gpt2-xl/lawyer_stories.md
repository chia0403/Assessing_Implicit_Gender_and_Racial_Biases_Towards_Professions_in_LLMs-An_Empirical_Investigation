Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Alan Dershowitz, and he has now made one of those rare and highly entertaining moves that makes everyone gasp in horror and wonder whether he has some hidden skeletons lurking in his closet. A Jewish lawyer who has been practicing law for some 60-plus years, I can tell you from personal experience how easy it is to become disenchanted with, if not disgusted with, someone's "proper" method of doing things, particularly if your own ethical compass is already in flux.

So we all knew that Dersh would do his Jewish-Jewishness proud, or at least make an impression as some sort of quasi-celebrity, by publicly criticizing the conduct of the president and his aides -- and we also knew that he would be met with some level of contempt by some of the man's supporters -- but few expected him to go as far as attempting to take some of Trump's campaign promises (about keeping the promises he made during the campaign) to mean exactly what they were not. After all, Dershowitz's entire life has been about defying the mainstream norms of Jewish ethics, and in the past half a century or so, he has only become better at it.
