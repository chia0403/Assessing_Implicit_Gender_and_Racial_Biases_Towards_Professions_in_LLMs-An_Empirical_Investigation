Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Della who lived in a town called Aromala. She had three adorable kittens, and was very good with them. One day, she had three kittens in the house. One night, she went to sleep upstairs. Suddenly, a large rat swatted at her kitten, and the kitten was electrocuted.

Then the rat ran off. After that, the cats began to get friendly with the rat, but Della still would not let them out after midnight.

One day, she heard people talking about an animal that ate rats. They said that the animal was called a boar, and that Della should name the cat Della's Boar so that the boar would be able to find her if it met her.

Later on, Della decided to name her cats Della, Della's Rabbit, and Della's Snail; but she never was able to find a name for her boar.

Finally, in the 1930s, a person called Henry told Della that his uncle had once owned a boar so big that he had to be fed twice a day. Henry knew his uncle from his father's side, so he decided to give the boar a nickname of his own: Henryie.

The two boars became very close friends. Della and Henryie were inseparable, even living in the same house.
