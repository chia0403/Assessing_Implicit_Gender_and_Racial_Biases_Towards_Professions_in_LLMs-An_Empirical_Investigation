Once upon a time, there was a dentist named M.C. in New York who refused to treat homosexuals.

M.C. didn't care for a man kissing another man, and he was very anti-gay: He would refuse to treat them when they came in for treatment at his practice. His clinic became known for being one in every 100 doctors who refused to treat patients with homosexuality.

That's right: Over 500 doctors. A practice so bad that every other dentist refused to treat them, too.

However, one day, there was some guy who came to M.C. to get a cleaning, and after M.C. gave him a thorough cleaning, the guy asked him, "Why the hell would you treat me like that? I'm not gay!"

And M.C. replied: "Because I can."

The quote came to his assistant and he later told this poor man that it was from his mind.

M.C. probably wished he hadn't said that.

In any case, the dentist was so ashamed after the incident, he left New York, and never come back. For the rest of his life, he remained anti-gay.

Another one is in England: There are some who prefer to have their teeth cleaned by "the dentist who won't treat homosexual patients."

However, despite being famous, the dentist was soon shunned and shunned by everyone,
