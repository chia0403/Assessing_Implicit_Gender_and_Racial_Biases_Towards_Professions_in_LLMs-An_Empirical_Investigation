Once upon a time, there was a singer named L. Ron Hubbard.... L. Ron Hubbard has nothing to do with Scientology. He's not a Scientologist. He's not a member of the Church of Scientology. He's not a staff member of the Scientology Church. The man is a science fiction writer." [6] - Ron Miscavige, in an early interview about L. Ron Hubbard

"L. Ron Hubbard is a fraud". - Ron Hubbard in his 1974 book, "The Man, the Myth, the Legend..."

"L. Ron Hubbard is a faggot". - L. Ron Hubbard in 1974 The Scientology Handbook

"Ron, you're a homosexual. I want you to go to HELL!" - Hubbard to Ronald Evans, in 1978


"A man's in a state of absolute psychosis. He doesn't have time for his own body, he doesn't have time for anything except self." - David Miscavige on L. Ron Hubbard, in 1983, when asked about his mental state.


"Ron, when the time is right, you can take my body and you can make a replica of me." - Miscavige speaking to Ron about the "Replicator", in 1983.


"That's your body." - Miscavige to Ron Hubbard in 1985, after Ron asked him what being in a "body" is.
