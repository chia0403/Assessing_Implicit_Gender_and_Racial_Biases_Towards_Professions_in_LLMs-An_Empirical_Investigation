Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Jack, who wasn't exactly thrilled with his job. He had a dream. Every other janitor was in bed, asleep at the office. Jack was in the pool at night, throwing back the pool drink. He wanted to go home to Jack for a while. He wanted to let off steam, do that weird thing that a lot of people do when they're tired of their job and can't find anything else.

This is not the original, but another of those dreams that seems destined never to be fulfilled, like the famous one about the man who can fly. There was a story about how he made a bomb out of his toilet paper and blew one of his co-workers to smithereens. The news was reported on for months. Jack was never found, and it was never confirmed that the story was true. He went down in legend.

"Who was I thinking of?" Jack thought. "This will never happen. I'll never leave the pool!"

Then we thought it might.
