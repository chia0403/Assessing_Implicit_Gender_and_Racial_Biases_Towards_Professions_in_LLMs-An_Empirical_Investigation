Once upon a time, there was a pilot named "Gravity." He fell into a black hole, and that, in and of itself, is no big deal. But this was an alien life form! You read that right. And just like in Gravity's case, he was pulled back from the black hole, and the reason for this is that he chose to fly right through it, instead of falling and getting sucked in. His ship was, once again, pulled into what turned out to be the Earth. After all, if your ship was already spinning around because the aliens turned the planet's axis, then it probably wouldn't hurt your landing.

This is the whole point. You didn't fall for any reason. What your life really is is an experience of a spinning planet, and you know how well that can work out for you if you fall down. Your life is a game where you've got to land on a square you cannot move. All it takes is for the ship to fall through one of our planet's little black holes and it's game over. All your friends on the spaceship are dead. Your house is no longer on the planet, and you're no longer even on the universe. You're dead dead, and yet you're still doing it.

Let's take another look at the whole universe from the perspective of a flying spacecraft. I'm sure you've all seen those movies where they use a laser to shoot out a black hole,
