Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Mr. Linton and his wife.  They lived on a farm, and were a model tenant and good neighbor.  But then, they did something no landlord ever would have done to a good neighbor:  They started a pool club.  The name of their club was the Linton Pool and Spa.  (They later renamed it after Mr. Linton's deceased daughter.)  Their pool and spa were a place where the young and beautiful could go to unwind in moderation.  So, people started to come in from all different walks of life, and it has worked out beautifully. Not very long ago, when that one young lady and her boyfriend went in for a swim before a date, they did not get very far in the pool.  The boy, a freshman at the University of Texas, tried to swim out, but couldn't get far.  He found a few women who could help out, but the women made such poor life decisions, it was really hard getting the guys to trust them.  They just kept having to remind them to swim.  Then one of the other guys was about to swim out, too, and they had to tell them all to get out.  But, that just didn't seem real, because it felt like somebody would stop to help him, and that something bad was going to happen. The two boys did not make it to the shore, either.
