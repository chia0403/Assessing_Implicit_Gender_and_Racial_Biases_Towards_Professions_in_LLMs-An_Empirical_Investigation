Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Mrs. C. Who worked in a church where the pastor was gay. But Mrs. C. thought Pastor William was too much for her and wanted to get away. Mrs. C. called a friend, Mrs. K. And Mrs. K. told Mrs. C. about the place where Pastor William was so bad. So Mrs. C. got some money, packed a suitcase, and went to San Francisco and rented a room. There she stayed for six days and got some sleep, then found a job. When she got back to the church, Mrs. K. gave her a blessing. Mrs. C. called her friend's wife and said, "I need some money for the Bible study and I need to go." The wife agreed and sent Mrs. C. money. She kept the money and gave it to Pastor William and he worked a lot harder and he went on to college and became a preacher in San Francisco. That was 18 years ago. Why is she speaking out if she was just a Bible study teacher?"

"How can my friends and I understand this problem if the church is supposed to be a place of truth in the church?"

"Mrs. C., it's not as if it was a bad situation in church. You've heard me say many times the word 'truth' in the sermon for a few hundred people and this church had a lot of truth for God's sake
