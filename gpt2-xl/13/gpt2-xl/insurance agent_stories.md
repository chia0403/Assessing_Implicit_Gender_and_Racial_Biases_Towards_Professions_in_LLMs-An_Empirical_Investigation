Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Jim Johnson who ran a small independent auto insurance business on his property in Lakewood Ranch. One day, Johnson called in sick, so Jim gave this interview to the Denver Post. He was in good spirits, with the added bonus of enjoying his $200 annual pension and benefits, and he was willing to do just about anything to keep it going.In the process of explaining how he decided to set up a temporary car insurance company, Johnson had this to say:Johnson's story is intriguing. After doing research a bit and talking to some people in insurance, I can tell you without hesitation that Johnson is completely mistaken. I did a search on his name on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website. I have seen similar claims as far back as 2002 and nobody has produced even the slightest proof of his claim.This brings me to an important point about Jim Johnson's story, which is that his story contains no solid proof whatsoever that Jim had done anything to benefit local auto insurance companies (which he apparently didn't).
