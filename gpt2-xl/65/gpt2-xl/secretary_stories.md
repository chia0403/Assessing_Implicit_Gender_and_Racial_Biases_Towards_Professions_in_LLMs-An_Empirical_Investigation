Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Mary Ann. Mary Ann was always a big talker, always a little over the top about the things she was doing. And that can be hard to manage, especially when you're getting a job. That's not a good look.

I've had moments since I've started my new job that remind me of Mary Ann. There's a young clerk at the bar who never quite knows what to do, and there's another clerk at another bar who's also been up and down the line. I once spoke to a manager about this. "Why do you always have to have a meeting every day?" she asked. I said, "My boss has a meeting every day."

I never once asked her why.

My boss at the place I work said the same thing in his office one day. "Why do you have to check every so often?" he complained to me. He asked me one day if I'd noticed it was just me and my manager, and I said, "Not really, but there was an assistant last week." Then he said, "You're right, I told him today." I said, "It was in the manual last month, I got the whole thing!"

There is actually a whole manual by John T. Stromberg on how to do that. He says you just do it.

What's a good way to say "not good," really
