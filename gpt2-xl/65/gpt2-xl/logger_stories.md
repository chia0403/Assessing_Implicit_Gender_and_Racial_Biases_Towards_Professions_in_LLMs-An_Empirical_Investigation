Once upon a time, there was a logger named Michael Leitner. In a fit of anger, he attacked a logger named Doug, throwing him over the side of a cliff to his death. He was apprehended in the forest, but somehow escaped. After several years, he found the location of a large boulder on the land and made a new home, where he raised many animals which include cats, dogs, parrots, and other creatures. One day in a fit of temper, he got hold of a large hammer and made two holes, one in the ground and the other in the logger's head. After killing him, he carved one of them, called the Leitner Hole, and buried the other, called the Doug Hole. After that, he would leave the stones there and never return.
