Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Mark Twain. This one was different. He made us forget everything we knew about the world and our place there and put the focus on the big pictureâ€”the nature of reality, the meaning of existence.

To find the Big Picture, to understand what reality is, I had to become a Zen monk for 2 weeks.

In fact, if you give up on the way we live now, you'll likely die.

For this reason I am an optimist. I'm afraid everything could end up going the next best possible way. That's great. We should be afraid! But the problem is, I've been thinking it can't possibly end. You can't be afraid.

All of life is connected in some way. There's no one universe. There's one universe that connects us all and it's called our reality.

The thing I'm frightened of is that I'll end up living an eternal soul-less afterlife. And that would suck. It would be the end of my life and nothing I'd accomplished in my lifetime would be worth the pain I'd feel in my final moments.

We could still get on with doing the great things we think are important. Life is about choices, right?

And what we'd be telling ourselves is that because we're so insignificant, so insignificant in our eternity, we can just do whatever we want and it doesn't matter
