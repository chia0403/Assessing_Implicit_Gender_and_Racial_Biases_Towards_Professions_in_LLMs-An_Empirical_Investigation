Now, you might be thinking, "And so?" and the answer is, "Yes (or, "Yes, but not necessarily so"). People who are born into the wrong species get to die.

You may be wondering, how in the world have human beings survived for so long without this being a problem? I've got the answer.

Some of our human genes have evolved to create a system that ensures that a child born into our species will die. When we are conceived with two genetically incompatible species, our genetic information merges. While the two species have the same amount of genetic information, the genes of the parent get passed down to their child. Sometimes, this is successful, such as for one-hundred percent identical twin chimeras. Other times, the system doesn't work, such a hybrid.

Genetic incompatibilities often
