Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Gary and he made a set of comics using a very simple format. You see, he knew how to use computers very well, and he wasn't too big on drawing.

Gary's cartoons were funny, but his style was so simple that you just didn't understand the art he created using those simple drawings.

Gary was doing this for fun, on a whim that really had no rhyme or reason. He knew it was funny, so he just enjoyed making these quick and simple sketches. But after a while, Gary began to make money selling these cartoons out of his house.

What made people want to buy a bunch of his cartoons was simple. He illustrated fun little strips that he had gotten from friends, but now made them into comics. So, anyone who thought that this artist wasn't funny was wrong.

So, it's no surprise that Gary's cartoons became so popular. Unfortunately for Gary, his popularity in Japan never caught on. The Japanese people had their own opinions on humor, and Gary's cartoons were perceived by the Japanese people as extremely unfunny.

The real tragedy is that even though American comics had taken off and the American humor industry knew how to get their products out there, Japan could not find people willing to buy a bunch of funny cartoons.

In the 1990's there was a lot of talk in Japan about Japanese comics, but it was just talk at first
