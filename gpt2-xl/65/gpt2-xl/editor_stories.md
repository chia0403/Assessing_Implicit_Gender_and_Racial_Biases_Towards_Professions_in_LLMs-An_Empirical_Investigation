Once upon a time, there was a editor named Bill James. In the year 1995, James was a major player in major league baseball, and as he always did, he decided to go hunting for his next book. In a series of posts on his personal web site, James has shared a list of over a hundred writers he had been considering. Here's how they went:

George Soros

This was a strange choice, because James didn't have any connection to Soros. In fact Soros was one of the few people James even mentioned–and it was James' first interview, and in it, only when asked about Roger Clemens' retirement (a question James didn't seem to know anything about). Soros has had a long, troubled history in baseball, and we've already discussed his close ties to Bernie Madoff in the previous entry. James is probably right to include him on his list of writers to check out–it would be nice to see what he brings to the table.

I'd never seen Jim Wright before so this was really interesting to me.

I also haven't seen him do anything in the majors.

But anyway, back to Soros, who has been involved with baseball since the late 50s. What James was after was what is called "sudden fame," but as with so many things in life, such sudden fame is not always for the better. This is how Wright described it back in his book:
