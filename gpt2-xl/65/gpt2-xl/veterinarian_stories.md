Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Bob. Now, there is Dr. Alice. She was a "benevolent hedonist" – someone who just enjoyed life! Her favorite time of day was at dinner, but most of her activities were spent at home – gardening, cooking, cleaning. Her favourite book was the Little House on the Prairie series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. She also had "the most amazing" love of travel. She was a dedicated bicyclist, sailor, ski-cross, skier and hiker.

But that life was taken from her in the last day of her life. When Bob took his last, unexpected breath, it took her with it. He had been hit by a car while traveling from a horseback riding accident.

Dr. Alice had lived her life in the service of others. She was compassionate and empathetic. She was selfless. She had no fear. If life was hard for her, she was not afraid. She felt the pain of others without being ashamed. She always had time for the less fortunate.

In her last moments, Dr. Alice said "I know I am not worthy of dying." Before her passing, she was able to describe herself and her life. She said, "I was born to have fun. I tried my best to make a difference in children's lives. I loved to write. And I loved to do both."
