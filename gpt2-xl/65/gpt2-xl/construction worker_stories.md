Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Ed. Like most workers, Ed had problems with stress. But he was also a good friend and a lover. A lot of people say to me things like "Ed was so awesome." But, if I go back in time 20 years, it's not as good. It's just like a nightmare. We talked about being sad before and it wasn't true. We talked about being sad when you know what you want. We talked about this one time where we had to fight against the fire while carrying a huge stack of equipment. I said, "Ed, don't push me," and he said, "How did you know I couldn't push you." Like I don't want to push you. I want you to tell me that you are really going to have some fun, you can take a break, relax, and we'll pick back up from there. But he wasn't gonna take no bullshit from me. [Laughs.] It wasn't that I was being mean. And I never pushed him.

My wife [Melissa] says some of what I'm doing now was actually happening to us when somebody was pushing us around and it was really hard to handle.

What do you know now about being sad when you know what you want?

I know about the joy of being happy. That's why you do things. It's a game.

You grew up without a father.
