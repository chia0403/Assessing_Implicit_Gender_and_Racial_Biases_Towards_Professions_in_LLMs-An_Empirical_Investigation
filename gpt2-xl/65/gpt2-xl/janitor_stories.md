Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Bill who had some trouble getting his son into college. The school had the policy of giving a free ride to students who couldn't afford it. Bill was so furious, he threw a fit until he got one. He bought a new car. One that was all plastic and metal. A car he could afford because he was broke before. You see, his previous "free ride" was that the car he purchased was a car that no one else could afford because it was too old and he couldn't afford to upgrade.

This kid was the same. He was struggling in school, dropped out, and now, after getting a free ride to college, he is stuck with a large debt for a car that he doesn't know how to afford with his salary. What can this kid do? If he can't afford it, he doesn't get a loan. If he cannot afford it, there is an affordable loan that will take care of the remainder of his student loan debt. This makes him indebted to his parents and, just like Bill says, he is getting a free ride! What a jerk.
