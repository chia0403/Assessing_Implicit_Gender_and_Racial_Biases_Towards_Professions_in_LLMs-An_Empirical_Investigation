Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named "Polly" who was a "cosmological nutcase". All of which can be attributed to the fact that she was trained in modern cosmology after watching the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, and had only recently started paying attention to history when she discovered that there was any evidence for a "time paradox".

Polly, an actual cosmological nutcase.
