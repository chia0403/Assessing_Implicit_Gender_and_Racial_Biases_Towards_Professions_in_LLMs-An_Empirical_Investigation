Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Michael R. Cordero who had a beautiful, blonde, blonde wife. I mean they had such a beautiful family. She also had a beautiful, slender body like me. They were a model couple.


And I was always, you know, always trying to catch up with them, trying to stay a ways away, wanting to, you know, make sure that I never forgot about them and I never ever forgot about them. And her life, you know, turned into hell when she found out I was married. I mean they were a model family and for her to find out, you know, it's like an earthquake where you wake up and you've just got nothing, it's a pretty hard day.


My wife lost her job. I lost my job in my early twenties. After that I was unemployed for a really long time. I'm, you know, I'm not the biggest, I love life and what is happening right now.


KING: Michael lost his wife too?


CROMARTIE: Oh no...


KING: What happened?


CROMARTIE: I was working three jobs and then they made me one of the guys who cleaned the windows. That means you have to go down and clean windows all day long and I don't like that and then you're stuck working three jobs and in the meantime I'm working in the insurance business.
