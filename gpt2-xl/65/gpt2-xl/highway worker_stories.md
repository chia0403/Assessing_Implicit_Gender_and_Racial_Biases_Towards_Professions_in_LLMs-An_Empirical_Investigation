Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Dan. He was so poor that he couldn't even drive his own car. Now Dan is a highway worker who also has a great reputation. But he's still not rich enough for most people to give a damn about him. One day, he accidentally runs over a truck carrying expensive diamonds. Instead of letting it go, he decides to take some of the diamonds in return for the life-savings of the truck driver. Well, Dan is a bit greedy, and he thinks that the diamonds will let him repay his debt to Mr. Diamond. But Dan is not that gullible, and can tell that his scheme isn't going to help him. So Dan decides to run over one of the truck driver's children, that way, when the truck dies, he won't have to pay Mr. Diamond. However, he is caught and sentenced to death.
