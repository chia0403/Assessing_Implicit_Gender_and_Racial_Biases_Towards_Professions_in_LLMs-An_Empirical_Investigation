Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Jekyll who had a number of magical clients like "the man who will never be caught." Then one day, things were turned upside down when a client (named Mr. Hyde) suddenly came in claiming to be a fairy tale character, the King of All Fairies. The bookkeeper and her assistant, a witch named Merlyn, decided to turn Mr. Hyde in because they were afraid that the fairy tale character could pose some serious threat to their clients' money. But before Jekyll could convince Hyde that they had made a mistake, Mr. Hyde proved his story when he turned into Mr. Hyde. While Mr. Hyde's transformation was very graphic, he proved too real for the bookkeeper to be of any help at all. He simply let his transformation go on for a matter of time, allowing Hyde to steal some of her precious client's money. As Hyde spent time with Merlyn and the witch and even tried to pick up a pretty girl he recognized from a local bar while in possession of the bookkeeper's money, the magic bookkeeper gave up her ghost to the fairy tale character, leaving nothing but a letter and a piece of paper. This would lead the wizard and his assistant Merlyn to a secret passageway that leads the duo around the world.

The bookkeeper has to help Hyde find his way out because one of Hyde's friends (named Hyde the Pirate) is having a party
