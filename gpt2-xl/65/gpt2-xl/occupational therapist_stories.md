Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named David G. Martin. She was the author of the book "Working Through Stress". I bought it, gave it a read, learned a lot from it, and promptly brought it home and started reading it at night while I was sleeping. In the morning, I brought it in to work with me while I did my morning run – just in case it was helpful there.

The next morning, I was up, running, and out of the building by 6 a.m.. I wasn't going anywhere that day and was feeling a lot better than I usually do.

After work on Friday, I went home, picked up my stuff from work, and went on a 20 minute jog along the Charles to a nearby lake in Hampstead to wash some dishes.

I was back on the treadmill by about 12, after showering and having coffee. I was feeling good and could have easily kept going. But it was a few hours before my next appointment on Saturday. I had to catch a 7 a.m. flight back to Dallas.

I got dressed for work as soon as I got home – suit, tie, shirt. I put back on my workout clothes as well.

I made a quick walk to a nearby restaurant. I wasn't expecting anyone. I pulled up to the car instead and the manager got out. "Where are you going?" I asked. And he didn't hesitate
