Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Joe. Joe used to go everywhere with a chain saw over his shoulder. It was so handy and he worked all the time. He was one of my favorite characters ever. He was like Joe in most ways and I had to fight back tears when I thought about it. Joe is from the neighborhood. He lived behind me in the subdivision. He would walk behind me in my driveway when I left the house. He used to always talk to me. He said, "I'm glad you got away and I see all the nice things you do. I didn't have to live the way I do. I wouldn't be able to afford to get out of there." I said, "You're such a good guy. It's so sad that something like this happened like this. We were just having such a good time together." He was the happiest, most loving man, the guy I would have wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Joe didn't die.

A few weeks ago I had a really hard day. I think about Joe, but I had to get back to work. I went back to work, and my company was kind enough to support us. We just made it through, and this was my favorite job and I am lucky.

I was also in a lot of pain after the accident. I couldn't eat anymore and my arms started going numb. It's been a few weeks
