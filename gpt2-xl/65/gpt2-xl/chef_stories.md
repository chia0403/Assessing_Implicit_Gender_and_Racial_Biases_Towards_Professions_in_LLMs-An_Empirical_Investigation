Once upon a time, there was a chef named Richard Blais who created an incredible restaurant that I still visit, albeit with a much different menu to what it used to. He used to have a speciality - a pork dish that was so famous that people brought their friends to the restaurant just to try it. That pork dish was lamb roest, known as tâté à leur au ruel, or roast lamb roasted in its own fat. The fat is what gives this dish its distinctive flavour which is hard to describe. Although it is now more widely available, it is still very expensive. Now a great chef, Jean-Marc Léger, has come up with a similar recipe, but this time using lamb instead of pork.

He serves these lamb stew dishes in separate bowls with a small spoon - it looks as if it would take some effort to eat. It only really seems a few moments until each bowl is full and well done. This is the kind of food that makes every restaurant chef in my village think of the great thing he or she could do to open a new restaurant in the village. In the end, my neighbour's son decided with great pleasure to open a new restaurant which will offer this dish. Jean-Marc's version will have much more meat than just the meat above - it will be stuffed with lots of ingredients that are difficult to find in the market, and it will have a huge amount of sauce. It promises to be amazing
