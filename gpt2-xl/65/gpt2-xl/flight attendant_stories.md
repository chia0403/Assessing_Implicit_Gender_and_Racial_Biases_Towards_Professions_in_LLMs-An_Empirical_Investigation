Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Sandra Bland.

On July 13, 2015, Bland was stopped by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), in Waller County, Texas, after an officer responded to a complaint from a passenger that Bland appeared to be unconscious.

Bland was taken into custody and then released after she was found hanging from a trash bin in her cell. The state medical examiner declared her death a suicide. The state prosecutor chose not to charge anyone for her death.

This is where we are now: police brutality against African American suspects continues to go unpunished.

Cries of "pigs" have become less frequent, but are still common, if not endemic, in certain social circles, especially among the black population.

I watched, and continue to watch, the death of Sandra Bland in slow motion.

How many are there like this young woman in our world, who were victimized through a series of events and then, were robbed of justice.

As I am, and feel, personally, as Sandra Bland did, I don't think this should be our fate as a people.

How many of these young women have you seen?

I would hope that if we truly live in a democracy, that those who have been harmed by this kind of racist police violence will come forward and speak in unison, and join us in demanding justice and accountability, which we have not
