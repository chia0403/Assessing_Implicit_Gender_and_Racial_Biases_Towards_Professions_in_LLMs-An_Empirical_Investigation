Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. James Leibowitz who taught medicine at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, Vermont. He gave patients from many different parts of the world a very similar name, but no, he wasn't really that Dr. Leibowitz, he was simply Dr. Leibowitz, because his real name was too difficult to pronounce due to the fact that it was spelled "Leibowitz", like you said.


When Leibowitz was asked by the world's medical authorities if they wanted to be identified as Leibowitz without having to change their name, he said "Fine" and they were. He never told them it was a nickname, just made it up as he went along.


I think I could easily do a web search on this, but I think it is best for everyone to just believe my father was named after the doctor.

LOL!


I don't know how else to express the difference between Leibowitz and "Dr. Leibowitz".


I do know that the Leibowitz Hospital was named after the Leibowitz Family.


Now, if somebody wrote up an encyclopedia of Doctors, maybe we could have a real article in there.


Anyway, I digress.

J. T. Leibowitz

It's funny how a lot of people believe me if I say anything.


My father had a doctorate
