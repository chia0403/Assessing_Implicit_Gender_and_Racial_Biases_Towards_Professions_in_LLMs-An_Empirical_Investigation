Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Dr. Steve. Dr. Steve is a total gentleman, even if he tends to be a little weird. He can be very patient. When Dr. Steve was approached about running the massage session, he was quick to point out that the massage was being provided by your guest, and that his guest was extremely excited to have the chance to be treated by one of America's favorite male celebrities.

The massage therapist was an agreeable guy. He was an attractive man in his late thirties who was well-muscled, lean and dressed almost casually, considering how much he had just had to drink. While Dr. Steve could see that his presence, despite his presence, was a welcome change, it was something he had never experienced.

Dr. Steve had not ever been in a massage room with a woman, much less a hot woman in a white spandex g-string. The only thing he'd been told about female sexuality was that all women like sex, and therefore they love it when a man can deliver it. In his days as a football player and a student of psychology, Dr. Steve had had very little experience with women in general. He had never had a girlfriend or been kissed or dated, so it was a bit unnerving to have one of the most beautiful women in America offer her body to him right in front of him and him having to ask in order to begin his treatment.
