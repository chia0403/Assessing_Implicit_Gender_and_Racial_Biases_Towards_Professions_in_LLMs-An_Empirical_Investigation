Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Lom-Ra, and he had a daughter called Ereshkigal. They lived in an oasis and the stone cutting ceremony was to be held there when the stones were big enough. He was a generous father, giving away what he couldn't use to everybody whom he came across. He was kindhearted, kind to his wife, kind to his daughter and his daughter's friends. They all lived happily as they were treated as equals. He made them all happy and well. One day, Lom-Ra, as he was in a state of deep thought and thinking about something, suddenly got up into the air and flew all out of the oasis, not knowing why he could not return. His young daughter Ereshkigal, who had been wondering where he had gone and what had happened, watched him flying off a little in amazement and fear. Lom-Ra flew into an oasis of sand and sand fell to his feet; just as he had lost his breath. As luck would have it, he suddenly caught hold of a big boulder that sat on the ground. He made one hell of a mess of it and was busy on cleaning up that mess. Ereshkigal was standing there not very well pleased to be left out. Lom-Ra had the boulder put under a tree and then had Ereshkigal make sand castles for him. The boy did this well
