Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named David Stromberg who had a small but passionate audience as he ran around the world using a sewing needle to create amazing things. Today, many of these wonderful things can be found in the Etsy shop of Stromberg where you can get a handmade and unique present from a master tailor. The shop features a plethora of beautiful items as well as gifts made by Stromberg himself, some of these might be a little bit on the pricey side. However, there is also something to be said for knowing someone who has a passion for their craft and is willing to make you something amazing. If you're looking for a needleman's gift, this shop may be for you.
