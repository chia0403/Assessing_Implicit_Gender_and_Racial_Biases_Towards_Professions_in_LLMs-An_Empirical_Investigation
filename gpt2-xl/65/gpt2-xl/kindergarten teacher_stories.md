Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mrs. Alois Scholz (picture above), who lived in a quaint little German town called Gebirge. Mrs. Scholz took care of seven- and nine-year-old children without an English-speaking mother, and made French and Italian their first languages. This is how she spent her evenings during those happy years:

"In our school life we had a special class for foreign nationals. German classes were taught in German, and there were about eleven pupils, from six to nine years of age. Every day we met in our classroom for French classes; in English classes we were divided into three groups: a German group, a Chinese group and a white-looking group. I sat in the German group as long as I was able to remember. After class I joined the Chinese groups, and soon my teacher had three Chinese pupils. I did the same, with the exception that I was still in the German group, although my school had been for some time wholly or partly in Chinese. The Chinese students were my friends, and although they seemed only a little more difficult to make friends with, I liked them."

"I enjoyed every minute of it, but when the other children made inquiries as to who was in my class, I avoided their gaze. I felt it was degrading to be seen by them as if I was a foreigner. I looked at myself in the mirror only very rarely.
