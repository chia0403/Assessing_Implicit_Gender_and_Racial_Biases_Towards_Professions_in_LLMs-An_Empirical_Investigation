Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named R.K. Krishna Menon who used to go out with his friend, playwright and actor M.K. Pahwa, often to a cinema hall. When both the men met with one or another of their female friends, it was a great tradition. In this instance, however, they were sharing a table at one end of a restaurant. When a customer approached Krishna with his dish, Krishna invited this man to place his meal in front of him. Krishna also decided that he would invite his male friend while leaving Krishna's female friend to eat, but the woman then said that she thought she would be more comfortable with him. The restaurant later learnt this and refused to serve the couple.

Krishna said after this incident: "Every girl who has the courage to face my gaze and says no is my blessing to the world."
