Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named "Bobby D." He was the only one who did all the feeding. He'd been doing it his whole life. As for the dogs, he treated them just like he was a baby and they'd follow him around. But now he doesn't go out of his way to get them milk anymore, even though they have food. Bummer for them.
