Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Bob. Bob's life was a bit odd.


A guy from China, traveling in London at the time, had told him about healing. This was the year 1557, at the start of the "Chinese Contradiction" - the conflict between the East and West. On July 15th, 1557, the two sides met in a great battle. The battle resulted in the defeat of the Ming and the Ming being renamed the Qing Dynasty of China. The war was concluded in 1644, with the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing. As a result, China regained its independence.


Bob was a young physician. He spent his off-hours doing experiments, searching for the right therapy. While in China, he met an old woman with a long tongue. A local herbalist had prescribed her the Tungsten carbuncle, a rare plant that was used to increase blood circulation and aid in treating everything from the cold to cancer (though no one really knows what it does). As Bob suspected, the woman had a little problem with her tongue. It grew around, becoming an enormous boulder.


Then Bob's little sister was born. Bob was excited about having two kids, so he began researching on her and her tongue. After weeks of trial and error, he got his therapy. Unfortunately this was considered a medical anomaly, and for a year and a half the family was denied reimbursement for the treatment.
