Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Mr. Stinky who was a member of a group called Dentists for Trump. Stinky, you may recall, has a very questionable history, having been convicted on multiple counts of medical malpractice in 1996. He also apparently has some history of sexual harassment and assault. Now, we know we could have done a whole article just on that. Still, it's good to know that even the people who work in the dental industry are still getting sucked into the swamp.

In addition, the Washington Post reports that Trump has hired the services of a new dental board member, Scott K. Shulkin, who has previously advocated for Medicaid cuts. As the Washington Post reports, the board members will help Trump navigate the complex system that regulates, monitors, and rates health care plan providers for patient quality and safety. Trump has reportedly been meeting with an adviser named Paul J. Ryan, who has been pushing Medicaid reform and cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits.
