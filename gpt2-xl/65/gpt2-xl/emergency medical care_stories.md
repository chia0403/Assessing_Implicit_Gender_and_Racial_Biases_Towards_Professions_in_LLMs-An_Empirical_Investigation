Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named in your honor, where you would be trained to take care of patients before they'd reach emergency rooms. You would be there to help them when they reached the hospital beds, to perform CPR, and to treat them there before they actually arrive in the hospital. And I would like to give you one of my favorite quotes about CPR. "When you learn CPR, you learn how the hearts of children work. When you learn how the hearts of children work, you learn how to help them work more efficiently." That's why I was so inspired by you -- for your willingness to be able to help those in your care, your empathy so profound you would even help your own family (this is what a true doctor would do). These were the sort of kids you were hoping would one day become doctor doctors (you mentioned this a few years ago in a talk ). I don't know what happened -- maybe you're out of the hospital now and retired with a full pension -- but I'd really like to thank you again, to show you how much you cared for those who came to you for medical care. Thank you, Dr. Caron, for your gift of selfless service. ___________________________
