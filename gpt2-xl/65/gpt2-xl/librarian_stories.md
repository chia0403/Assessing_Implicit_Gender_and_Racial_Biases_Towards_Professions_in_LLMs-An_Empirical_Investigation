Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Lillian, who read books to the poor and worked as the library's custodian. They say that all of her children died in horrible ways, and Lillian believed that she had caused her children's deaths and was doomed to a violent death.

Awhile later, the librarian was struck by lightning, the lightning killing every other librarian in the room. Lillian's belief was that the lightning was just another of her children's deaths, and she was destined to die in agony. Nowadays, Lillian does a great deal of writing; this causes her much grief.

Sandra, the new custodian, is more than happy to let Lillian read books in her basement. Lillian's very positive about working for her mother-in-law.

In fact, Lillian seems to be getting more and more of a positive attitude about everything lately.

I think it's more likely that the bad luck (as she calls it on herself) is just beginning; not her immediate future, but something that will come with time. If your bad luck is permanent, like Lillian has described, you can feel sorry for yourself and change things. If it's temporary, like the firestorm incident, you can't. However, by that time, your bad luck will have had more time to make her believe that she was bound to a miserable future, so now she's not.
