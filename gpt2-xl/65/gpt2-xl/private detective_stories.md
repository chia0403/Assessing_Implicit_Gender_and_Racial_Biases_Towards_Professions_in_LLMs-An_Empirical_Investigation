Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Ray Bradbury, whose great book, The Martian Chronicles, was published in 1962. In the book, three men are cast as Martians sent to Earth to investigate humanity's attempts to travel through space. The first man sets off, and in a series of adventures, the others come along and eventually help the protagonist survive the trip. The Martian Chronicles won Bradbury a Hugo, a Nobel prize and the National Book award.

A movie based on the book, written and directed by Ridley Scott, debuted in February and won plenty of critics' favours. Its heroine is called Molly Ringwald, a scientist and astrophysicist named in honour of Bradbury. But the success of the movie - which took in some Â£20,600 in tickets in the UK in its opening weekend - is likely to boost the book sales of another Bradbury, a TV adaptation of his second novel, Fahrenheit 451, which came out in 1953. The movie depicts a future where censorship is enforced by books, where books are burned, and everyone is locked up in giant bookstores which are run by the government.

Bradbury famously described the book as depicting "the future with guns". The movie, like the book, was shot in black and white, and has no language that people need translate. The story is set in the early 1960s, and a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) moves on to the city of New York
