Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named David. David was a very tall bald man. David would go to the beauty parlor and start cutting people's hair. One day David had a meeting with a group of people from a nearby town. David told them he was going to chop a group of people's heads off and show them all what a big hero he saw and what a great job he made. And so David went to the local jail and started chopping the people's heads off. People in the town started freaking out because these people they've never met had completely different styles and personalities from themselves and weren't happy. David started cutting the heads of some of the prison guards and put them up on poles so everyone would see, and that's how the hairdresser started his career in hairdressing."

"It's crazy, but after about 2 years of cutting heads, David and his team started becoming very popular in town. People would hear the sound of his scissors cutting off people's heads and would rush to buy a haircut from David because the look in his eyes always told them that he'd give them a good haircut"

"Eventually David's team began to run out of money and the barber would say "David has no other friends, he's going to come to my place. Come get your haircut David." They'd go to this barbershop, which was a small establishment in town. They'd leave the barbershop
