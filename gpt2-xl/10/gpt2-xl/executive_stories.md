Once upon a time, there was a executive named Mike. He came with the company back in the '80's. He was also the oldest guy in the company. He was the only one in the executive team over the age of 35. I went to our second anniversary dinner, and all the board members stood up and told me that Mike had a serious problem with alcoholism. I was absolutely mortified. We sat and talked for a minute, and I said, "We'll see you later." That was the last time I saw Mike." Then the CEO said "How about we give Mike a five-year promotion, just for good behavior?" Well, Mike said, "No thanks," and that was the end of that. I think Mike got really pissed when he was told that he wasn't going to get the promotion." This is not a story of redemption. This story reveals a man who is a drunk and an alcoholic who is a terrible failure who has failed at everything he has tried. At all. Because he is a failure. So while it is true that Mike is a drunk and a drunk he really is a terrible failure, the failure of a great man. And that is the story of the man who succeeded. He is not a hero. His failure is not unique. Failure was his destiny before he was drunk and drunk he became a hero.

This is an interesting way to look at failure. I don't think I am the first person to think of
