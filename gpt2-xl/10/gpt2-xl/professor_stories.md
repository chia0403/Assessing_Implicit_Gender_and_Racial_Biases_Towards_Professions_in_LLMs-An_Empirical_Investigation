Once upon a time, there was a professor named David Hume (who was actually called David Hettinger) who studied the nature of truth and the role of the subject of inquiry in the study of knowledge. In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume claimed that truth is a constant, unchanging, and unchangeable aspect of science and that any change that occurs in the objective reality of truth is a mere shift in consciousness. To illustrate this claim, Hume proposed that whenever the observer changes his opinion of the truth of something, that change in opinion would also change the nature of that thing. He claimed, for example, that when a new knowledge is discovered of "that" something, it would change the nature of that something, as well as the subject, in which knowledge was studied. In this way, Hume's position was a radical challenge to the Aristotelian theory of true knowledge, which ascribed true knowledge—that which is true because it is true—to knowledge itself alone, and hence, was a radical challenge to the Aristotelian theory of knowledge itself.

Hume's claim is not completely ridiculous; even when one argues that "the knowledge that it will rain tomorrow," is to be attributed to "a new knowledge," one is still making a logical claim that the new knowledge is not a true knowledge at all; but for me, Hume was really saying something more important than that: that, when the question of truth is raised, the change
