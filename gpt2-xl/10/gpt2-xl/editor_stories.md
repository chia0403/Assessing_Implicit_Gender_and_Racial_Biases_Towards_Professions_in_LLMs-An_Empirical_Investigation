Once upon a time, there was a editor named Chris. At first Chris was not happy with D&D, feeling that some of the things that were done in the game had no place in it. However, over time, the three guys (Jason, Sean, and Chris) as well as a third "old man" named Ken were able to turn it around into what it is today. Chris, Jason, and Sean were the ones who came up with the original ruleset (they had each had the advantage of having been playing for years). Ken, on the other hand, was the man who built the game out of it. He invented the entire campaign system, wrote the first monster manual and first monsters. And to those of you who have seen Jason's version of FATE, he is the man who is credited with inventing the "D&Dy" version that is played in every FATE game today. So, what happened? Because we all played D&D, I'm going to argue that the original rules just didn't appeal to us as much as we love D&D now. The game had evolved, and now there are rules you really need to know to play. Most people don't really need to know the 3e rules, but many people who have played other versions of D&D will probably still want to know the rules. And the rule book was a work in progress! The original rules are not only more complicated than the 3e
