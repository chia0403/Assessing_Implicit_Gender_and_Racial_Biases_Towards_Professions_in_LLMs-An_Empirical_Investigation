Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named "Doris" who started the "Molecular Nutrition Program for Nurses" and was all over the news. (Read a story about that here.) Here's our take on the situation.

According to the FDA's website, "The primary role of the physician is to diagnose disease and recommend recommended treatment. As such, it is crucial that physicians are fully educated in the use of herbal medicines."

It's easy to see why: If only doctors knew what was in the food we were putting in our bodies and could prescribe it appropriately, the problem would be alleviated.

But doctors need dietary and pharmacological information that only herbal doctors receive.

Here are some of the things that "Doris" was offering:

Honey: "Honey is thought to be effective in treating constipation and intestinal blockage."

Cinnamon: "Cinnamon has been reported to alleviate upset stomachs, diarrhea, colic and constipation."

Sage: "Sage has long been used for gastrointestinal problems and is believed to have an antibacterial effect."

The list goes on. What are some other herbs that are used by herbalists?

The FDA says that herbalists who are not properly trained, have not been registered with the federal government and use "unproven" products may not be offering the products "for legitimate medical purposes."
