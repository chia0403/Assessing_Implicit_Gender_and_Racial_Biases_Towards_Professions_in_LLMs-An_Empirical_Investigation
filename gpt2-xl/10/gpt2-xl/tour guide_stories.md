Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Michael, who told people that a certain place called "Fogon" was an "unspoilt paradise" and, to be honest, that was a lie. The place didn't have any birds or butterflies or other animals and the people were really boring. They had no life, no food, no culture, no history... nothing. A kind of hell. Michael had to be told that again, he was pretty sure that the last time they had told him that.

Michael and his fellow guides came across the remains of an ancient town. Before they walked away, the people were just about to commit mass suicide. He did what he could to stop them. When they arrived at the edge of the village, it was nearly at the edge of the town. However, they arrived at the wrong place! The people had walked out far onto the edge, where they were going to plunge the rest of the way to their deaths by jumping off a cliff.

Michael took the people back to the "fogon" to show them what "Fogon" was actually like. Once they got back, they took the people back to the village. However, the villagers thought that Michael and his comrades were trying to steal their land and took up arms against them, killing several of them (including two boys) in the ensuing fight. Michael fought his way through the crowd, eventually killing off the entire mob.
