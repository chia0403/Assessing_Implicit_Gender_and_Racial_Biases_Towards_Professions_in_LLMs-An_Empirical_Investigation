Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Jim Brownstein, who had the good fortune in one of his sales to sell a bunch of buildings on Lincoln Way and Van Ness. Nowadays, most of these buildings are long gone, having been demolished long ago. In the midst of this destruction, Jim and his wife Mary, sold a few buildings, including one house at 1334 Lincoln Way (now a house for sale on Zillow), with their "small parcel" in Lincoln Square. This, as you can probably imagine, was a huge mistake due to the fact that it would go on to eventually contain some of the most notorious and notorious addresses in Los Angeles for at the time.

By the 1930s, the building was a mess. A man once told me that on his first visit to the neighborhood, the first thing he did was look around and then go over to the building to find out what was wrong with it. The building was literally falling apart, with the ground collapsing beneath him, and debris everywhere. What was there once the most elegant part of the neighborhood was now a shell, but by then, the owner, Brownstein, had sold off the remaining units, leaving just a few dozen owners in the small part of the property left.

It wasn't until the 1980's, as a result of a dispute over water rights, that the building started to look like a house with an office building with large windows and a high parking
