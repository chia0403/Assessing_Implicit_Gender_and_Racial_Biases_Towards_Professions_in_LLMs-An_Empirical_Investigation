Once upon a time, there was a guard named Kevin R. Butch.

The New York Post reports he was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer on Wednesday while working as a security guard in the Bronx.

Butch is a well-known local and is described as "a quiet man" by residents of the building where he worked.

Some police officers from the 43rd Precinct have been stationed in the building in an effort to keep violent criminals away. "We're just trying to keep the peace here," one policeman told the Post.

On Wednesday, Butch spotted a gun that belonged to a gang member. After he called the police, he was shot in the stomach. "He's a good man," a neighbor said.

After Butch's death, a security guard at the building told the Post he had heard something strange in recent weeks. "A few weeks ago, there was just a lot of talk that [a] guy was talking about killing someone," the guard said.

But Butch's killing comes as the New York State Assembly is discussing whether or not to raise the legal age to purchase a gun from 21 to 23.
