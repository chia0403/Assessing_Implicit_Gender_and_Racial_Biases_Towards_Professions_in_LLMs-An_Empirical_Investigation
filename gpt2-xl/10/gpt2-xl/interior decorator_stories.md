There was a door with a little peephole over it. And she was always peeping, sometimes with great anxiety, at the door.

In a very small space, there was a little apartment filled with all sorts of odd finds, and she always wanted to see something in each of them. So she peeped at the little peephole door.

When she did, she saw something that scared her to death. For all she knew the little peephole door could lead to her worst nightmare â€” a place where she might never reach again!

She called the police and told them her story. She told them all about the creepy little peephole door.

Her police buddies went a little nuts, too. The detective had some real questions for her; what door did you see? It seems pretty likely that Linda used to try to peek in all kinds of doors. He was just curious. It turns out, she said, that she was right.
