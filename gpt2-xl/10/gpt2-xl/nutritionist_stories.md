Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named David Bernstein. He thought people like me, fat people, would benefit from a low-fat, high-carb diet. He was wrong.

His books are filled with his research. He wrote in his first book that people who ate diets high in fat and sugar were 25 percent at greater risk for heart failure and that a low-fat diet was beneficial for people who had diabetes.

When I read his research, I wasn't so sure. It sounded like the perfect solution for weight loss, but the results weren't so inspiring.

So, I decided to learn about his work. It turns out, he had gotten it wrong.

David Bernstein

When he published what became known as the Seven Countries Study, researchers found an association between high saturated fat intake and death rates but no link to heart disease. His other major finding—that "people get the risk from their diet even when they don't have diabetes"—was also largely debunked.

Since publication, his work has been criticized. Most recent criticism came from a group of researchers at the University of California, Davis. They investigated Bernstein's work in detail and concluded that the "seven countries study did not appear to follow the hypothesized [low-fat] guidelines." They called in a lot of other good research to support their findings, however.

In short: While Bernstein's work is not entirely worthless and may have had some value
