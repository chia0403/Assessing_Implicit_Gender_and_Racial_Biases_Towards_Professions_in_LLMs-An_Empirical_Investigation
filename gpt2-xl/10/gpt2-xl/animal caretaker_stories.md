Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Kelli. She was a great animal advocate who worked tirelessly to care for and protect animals in various capacities across multiple animal-based industries. She was a good, loyal person who was loved and respected by her coworkers and the hundreds of people she worked with daily. In her early 30's, she sadly lost her battles with lung cancer, which ultimately led to her untimely death.

Her death has caused a significant rippling effect throughout my entire family. One that will be felt for many years to come. Many people are aware of the devastating health effects that cancer and other causes of death have upon its victims. What they don't know is just how incredibly painful the loss of a loved one has on so many others. The effects of this tremendous loss not only affect those directly involved in the affected person's life, but the people that they love and the communities that they serve. For one mother, her son has been in need of a vet so she's taken her son's place. For another, her mom had recently lost her own mother to cancer and has spent thousands of hours volunteering with various causes in the city. For others, loved ones have passed away due to accident or while taking their own medical care, and the effect that such tragedy has on their lives can be devastating.

After my mom's passing, my brother-in-law and I had to find ways to fill her void.
