Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mr. Crème. One day, he had a client who wanted something really special.

He thought about this for a moment and then, he just decided to make a huge surprise birthday cake for someone he hardly knew. That day, he decided to make a cake in the shape of a cake. The cake was actually Mr. Crème's handiwork.

Mr. Crème created that elaborate cake and it was just beautiful to behold. The cake was perfect, had a lot of layers, rose for the day it was decorated and people asked why it was decorated in that fancy way. They asked him at the party, "why was it so pretty?"

At first, Mr. Crème asked, "why do you ask?" but, the more he thought about it, he decided to tell the truth at the party.

Everybody knew the cake was just for Mr. Crème.

Mr. Crème couldn't say he wasn't happy with how it turned out.

If you've ever wanted one of your cakes to take on the shape of a giant cake, what would you say to the person asking why it looked so special?
