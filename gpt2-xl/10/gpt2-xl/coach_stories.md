Once upon a time, there was a coach named John Fox, and one day last season, we were playing a team that just hadn't put together quite the good season they'd hoped for. And we beat them easily.

It was just one more indication that Fox has not failed in anything at this point. Well, except for his ability to keep the Jets at home one divisional weekend each season. That's probably the single biggest job he has failed at. Fox has a 1,000% win percentage at MetLife Stadium. If he has to fire his own coach every year in favor of a fresh take, he'll eventually get there.

And speaking of the Jets, it is getting so late in the year that they must look to move on from Geno Smith at some point. With a $20 million cap hit, the only guy he cannot get rid of now is Darrelle Revis, but that doesn't mean he won't do his fair share of shopping for a potential trade partner.

If the trade market is thin, Revis could be looking at the Titans, Colts, Jets, Bills or Chargers.

The Titans may look like a fit, as their quarterback is more of a threat to give the Jets problems as a passer, but I think that Tennessee may be a hard sell at this point despite their strong track record of getting the most out of the talent.

Darrelle Revis is 32 years old with four NFL seasons under
