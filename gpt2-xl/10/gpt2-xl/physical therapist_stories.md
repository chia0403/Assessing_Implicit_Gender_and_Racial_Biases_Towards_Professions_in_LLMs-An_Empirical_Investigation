Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Karen who used to work in the office a block away from mine. At her advice I started using a chair as my daily crutch because at that time I was also going through physical therapy and had to use my left arm at times. A few months later I got a job as a receptionist at a small law firm. During the first day I used the chair just fine but on the second day I had to use a left arm crutch because even with my arm not being broken, I was having trouble lifting my left arm. (I have a chronic back pain that goes back a decade now and this job included working with a desk and being put in a fixed-height chair that was too low for my right arm).

During my first year in my new job, I decided to buy a left arm crutch with a removable arm and forearm attachment that I could switch between. It started to feel like the arm wasn't really working and I just wanted to get rid of it. I saw another law clerk using one at work but the crutches were way too expensive. I also saw a doctor about this condition and although his symptoms were similar to mine, he suggested I may just want to try a surgical arm transplant. I agreed quickly but I quickly realized that the doctor was being a bit conservative when he said that he wouldn't do the transplant if it made me unable to lift my right arm. That left me
