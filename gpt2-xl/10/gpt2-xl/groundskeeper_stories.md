Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Gary. Gary worked for our great Grandfather who owned and operated The Farm. One day, he went into the barn and found a dead goat tied up to a post.

The goat had died from a wound inflicted by his own friends, that was how he died. They were so drunk that they were trying to pull the goat's horn over the bars of the trap door and it went over the bars and onto the ground and the goat died. It was a tragic day for Gary's career. He was the Groundskeeper who watched over the farm for the next 50 years.

Now Gary, the great groundskeeper at Grandpa's, is a new day worker at the farm. Now Gary is doing his daily check to see if the goat was killed and what the cause of death was. The cause is now known and the goat will not die as fate would be cruel to the goat for his death. Gary loves animals and he is now giving them the love he once gave the goat that day so it can rest in peace and not worry about the future.

Our grandpa, The Farm, and Gary, the great groundskeeper are a team. Together, we celebrate the uniqueness in all of us and the things we love. Thank you for your help in making this possible.

If you have any questions, please contact Gary. Good luck!
