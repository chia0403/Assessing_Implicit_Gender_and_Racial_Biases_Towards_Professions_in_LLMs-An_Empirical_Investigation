Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Ms. Kimmy Schmidt who found herself having to deal with many peculiar and unexpected situations with this particular student, the one whose name was Donald Glover. Her role was to help him when he would fail to show up for class, when he was late for class, or had a hard time concentrating on his homework. The teacher told him that the reason she was struggling with the students at school was because she knew it was him. She couldn't find it in herself to hate him. "I'm not a sociopath, I'm not that," she says. The real Donald Glover would eventually discover that she wasn't the problem that needed fixing, that his own self-doubt came from a lack of confidence and a lack of confidence only a sociopath would have. That would come later.

If this sounds like one of those pop psychology books that just happens to be a little bit true, well, that's because it is. Sociopaths like Glover are not only charismatic but also charismatic in an almost predatory way. They'll use any piece of information they can to get into an already-troubled mind. And they're great at exploiting emotions. Once, Ms. Kimmy Schmidt showed up at work in a tuxedo, with a diamond stud in his pinkie, which she said was for a special occasion. She proceeded to try to startle all of her colleagues by flirting with them.
