Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jim. Jim is kind and kind-hearted, which makes him kind and the reason most people want to be kind. He just seems like a decent fellow who, once upon a time, spent his whole life fixing cars and being kind to people.

This led to Jim meeting and marrying a lovely woman named Joanne. Jim and Joanne were both kind, warm, and loving, and Jim always helped her in their business and in life.

Sadly, Jim's nice reputation came at a price. Jim began to make a lot of money, and to some, they began to see Jim as greedy. His family and Jim knew that he could not do this to their livelihood, and so they made the difficult decision to move away from his business to protect their livelihood.

When Jim and Joanne moved to a place in the country, in a quiet country town, things seemed to be going well. But when Jim discovered that Joanne was having an affair, Jim began to find himself out of sorts. Joanne seemed to be completely unfazed by the scandal, and she always seemed eager to make new friends, especially since she found that Jim seemed to want to be friendly with everybody.

Soon, Jim began to notice that his former co-worker, Steve, also seemed to find Joanne with Steve, and they began to have an affair as well, only that they seemed to be together every day
