Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Charles Beaumont (or so it was thought). Beaumont was a highly respected and successful director of shows in the 1800s and early 1900s but, by the 1900s, Beaumont's career had come to an end when a tragic accident caused him to lose his memory and be trapped in a world which he could not remember. A story like this one is very difficult to perform. If you are writing a long period play without a story or characters that are defined, the plot, setting and characters all become a secondary concern. This is difficult especially for an unreliable narrator which allows for even deeper questions to be asked. What if the protagonist, the narrator, never met Charles Beaumont? Wouldn't that introduce more questions if the story had to rely on your memory to get us through? When you are writing a scene that relies on the memory of the character you are writing as, it is just more difficult to remember the event but, having said that, the truth of the events is more important than the memory. There are a multitude of stories in the theater but that's what we are doing...we're telling a theatrical story and that is more important. Beaumont had a brilliant vision for the art form. He wanted to recreate the magic of the play. The only problem there wasn't one so much as it was many. It was a very difficult process to produce a play that has the same spark
