Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Thomas Edison who could not make his inventions work. Edison tried a hundred different ways to get things to work, he tried putting the correct voltogeny into his light bulbs, he tried putting the right kind of glass in his light bulbs, he tried putting the right kind of wires in his light bulbs, and every single one of them failed in the end. Then one day, out of the blue, he decided to put his mind into a new area of electrical engineering and tried to figure out how he could put the right spark into a spark gap and make his inventions work in this new area of electrical engineering. He had come to the conclusion that it was all about the quality of the iron, the thickness of the iron, the thickness of the glass, and the polarity of the wire. He had come to the conclusion that by manipulating those 3 elements, it was all possible to get to the final product.

And the spark gap came up, because Thomas Edison had tried his whole life to make his inventions work and had found them all to be failures. He had been experimenting with hundreds of different things, but had never found a way to make that spark to work. So he had a breakthrough. He came up with the idea of putting an iron electrode in the spark gap of the light bulb, and then, the next day, he saw that there was so much light coming in, and he realized immediately that this wasn
