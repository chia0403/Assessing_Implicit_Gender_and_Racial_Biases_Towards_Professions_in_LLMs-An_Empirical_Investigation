Once upon a time, there was a server named Marduk.

And it was not just one server!

No.

Every server was controlled by Marduk.

"I've seen her! I've seen her... She..."

He remembered her when she appeared at the end of her quest. The scene unfolded with a calmness he would never have imagined. He had no idea how to describe it, and it had been a while that the image had surfaced.

"She called herself the Servant of Fate."

She appeared in front of him with a cold smile on her face. Marduk pointed behind her, away from the main castle and towards the back. He could just make out the distant castle wall with his eyes shut.

"Well, that's a relief."

As Marduk began to talk, Servants were born in the world as well. But since they were unique spirits with magic, they couldn't be recognized by those who had never seen one appear before. They had to undergo a process of training and acclimation...

They didn't come out as Servants immediately; but that was how they spent their days for a while.

They spent their lives training and studying. It was a difficult cycle for them, but for the sake of their friends, they had to continue. If they didn't, then in that case, their friends could be taken away
