Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Dolph Schramm. While doing chores at his job in Minneapolis, Schramm's business partner, Mr. Fender, had invited him out for an after-work cigarette. Thereafter the two became "best friends." They continued this arrangement for months. At the end of that month, Schramm decided to go back to New York and find his fortune. Fender, at first, wanted him to stay put, but Schramm had other plans. On Feb. 25, 1933, he was at the height of his powers. "With the money I would make from home," he told "Honey," of his New York plans, "I should go and set up in New York. The city has got to have somebody else do the menial work. If Fender wouldn't make me a millionaire in New York, I would do it somewhere else."

Schramm thought it would be easy to find a job at Fender at a salary of 30 dollars an hour. The owner wasn't impressed and urged him to go back to Minneapolis before the end of February. Despite the boss's insistence, Schramm accepted his invitation to continue the business relationship. "I had to go see," he remarked, "or else Fender, my business partner, would have nothing left to sell me." After an uneventful trip to Minnesota, Schramm was back on his business trip.
