Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Mary Beth.

On January 19th, 1963, Mary Beth returned from her trip to Europe and she boarded her flight to San Francisco.

She was seated in the middle of the plane.

As her passenger was being sworn in, he said that he needed a bottle of wine to go on the trip.

Mary Beth looked at him and said, "you don't need a plane ticket for a wine, do you?", meaning alcohol.

The passenger responded by stating that he did drink occasionally, and after he had to use the bathroom, after which he thought he would take one more drink.

Instead, Mary Beth asked that he fill her last glass with water.

Instead of saying yes, his responses went something like this. The passenger responded, "Well, I'm not really into drinking any more, so there's just not enough in my stomach for it."

Mary Beth looked into his eyes and said, "Well, good for you. If you still drank then you should eat something. Why don't you have a snack and I'll get you some water."

His response was, "I should probably get some sleep before I go on another such trip." He would often sleep during flight and he would wake up exhausted. Mary Beth got his seatmate to let him sleep in the middle of the plane. The man slept for a good six hours.
