Once upon a time, there was a pilot named "Stabbed, But Not Killed" (or something like that). "Stabbed" is a fairly new (to me) term to describe a pilot who survives being "stabbed". In the old days, this would mean a broken hip or a shot to the arm. One thing I've noticed is that this is usually the least-damaging damage done by the pilot. You might say, "Gimme 10 years and Stabbed but Not Killed is fine, I won the war and Stabbed but Not Killed is just a waste of effort." As of this point in the campaign, the pilot who is "staggered" is one shot to the arm, three puncture wounds, four puncture-puncture-wounds (no less than three times if you have one of those guns laying around), three missing, and one amputated. No puncture wounds to the leg, no puncture wounds to other limbs, no puncture wounds. Not bad for a single shot to the arm.

"Taken Out, But Not Killed"

So that leaves us with taken-out which is the most severe damage done to the pilot. A pilot who was "taken out" is likely to lose the use of their leg and/or their arms in addition to various other more serious wounds.

This is not to say that taking out is always the end of the pilot
