Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Michael Mancuso, who treated the hospital's own pet monkeys with a bizarre mixture of steroids known as "monkey dandruff shampoo." Mancuso eventually quit his job for various personal reasons, and his staff of monkeys got worse and worse. The worst of it is that Dr. Mancuso never made a public statement about his role in the abuse, which is the first thing we need to take away from The Monkey King!

You're looking at the film with a little bit of curiosity. Who are the cast?

Forget "cute" and "talented"â€”the rest of the world knows who the cast are. The film's characters are almost solely human. Some of the animals also have human qualities, but for the most part, they seem to be little more than cartoon caricatures.

Like many animated films with humans in leading roles, the film suffers from a very bad translation of character behavior into real-world behavior. Not only is it hard to relate to the animals' actions, but it's hard to believe that the people acting them are capable of that kind of behavior.

The film opens with a couple being caught on a movie set. One of them is a monkey with weird facial hair. We're immediately introduced to the character of Mr. Trombone (played by Alan Arkin) by his human girlfriend.
