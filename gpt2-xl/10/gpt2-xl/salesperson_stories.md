Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Steve in a department store who was a bit of a dick. And as a result of him, the people in his department were starting to dislike the store manager and were starting to get unhappy with each other. The assistant manager had had it up to here with Steve and she decided to do something completely out of the ordinary. She decided to do something Steve wouldn't like.

Steve was still at the manager's workplace when his boss came in. She made an announcement that all salesperson should be off duty until after the holidays. And that day, Steve was allowed to show up.

Steve was confused. Why couldn't the manager call the whole thing off?

A little while later, when Steve had finally finished his shift in the store and was driving back to his home, he saw a man wearing a very expensive suit and a bow tie riding a white horse. The man looked exactly like Steve's old, old boss had looked. He stopped the car right next to Steve and spoke to him.

"Hi there, Steve. I'm Bill Clinton, and you can call me Bill Clinton anytime."
