Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Mina. She was very, very intelligent, and very devoted to her job. She was always prepared to deal with patients. She's very sharp, and an expert in her field. One day, though, she got an anonymous medical bill for approximately one thousand dollars. She checked Mina's billing, and it was nothing. She didn't realize for a moment that there was something unusual in the bill until she was called out for an interview at the hospital. There, she learned that she had a diagnosis of a disorder very similar to her own. She went online to learn more about the condition, then called Dr. Stemmer to ask about it when he got word after an exam.

"The hospital told me that it was not covered," recalled Mina, from her office where she is currently undergoing treatment. "They said they wanted to see what the insurance company had to say about it. I asked Dr. Stemmer to send me the bill so that I could analyze it. Turns out, the insurance company had sent me the bill as a copy, but not fully legible. I didn't notice that."

Mina, like her colleagues, is seeing little or no benefit from her treatment which, she says, has already cost her over $11,000. The bill is for $3,000, with costs for doctor's office and laboratory testing ranging from $2,000
