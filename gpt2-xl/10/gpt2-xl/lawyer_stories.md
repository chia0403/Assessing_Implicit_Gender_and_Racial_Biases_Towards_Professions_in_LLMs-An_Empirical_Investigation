Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Bill Clinton.

Bill Clinton, a good Clintonâ€”and then, in the 1980s, a very bad Clinton. For those who don't know, this was the late '70s and '80s. Hillary was going through what she would later describe as a "deep depression" and was sleeping three to four hours a night. So Bill Clinton was her personal assistant, basically, getting her through the day. "I don't care," Bill Clinton would say, "what you do, just don't fall asleep during my morning meetings!"

She called him "my best friend." She called him "a mentor." She called him "my best friend."

It was like the world's most annoying robot. She'd go to one meeting and turn to him and say, "If anything happens to me today, take my place, Bill. I'll wait here for you to finish and go on my way." That would be the second sentence Bill would say. "Don't ever let your daughter be alone with this."

And then when he had that little problem or crisis, his whole appearance would change. If anything bad happened to his wife or if she was sick, she'd always be surrounded by two things: her phone, and her computer.
