"He didn't get in," said Chuck Dederich. "He died on January 4, 1972 of an overdose in his hotel room in California, and he was a radio technician."

Dederich later joined the National Radio Astronomy Observatory; Dennett had been an astronomer at Cornell University (with Charles Greenlee) and at the Lick Observatory in California. Their first mission together occurred in the Fall of 1959, when the telescope was just beginning its construction: "We had taken the first observation of the Earth-centered quasar in the constellation Cygnus and, from that, we learned its identity as a magnetar, a super-dense neutron star formed from the collapse of a large star. We were the first scientific mission to directly image a star that is more than 10 billion times the mass of our Sun."

After the launch of Siding Spring, Dederich said, CBS radio broadcasted the news on September 15, 1958: "A Supernova May Be Shaping the Future. "

"At the time, the only radio telescopes in the world were those operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Washington, where we did most of our work during the 1950s and 1960s," he said. "We continued to produce television programs, but didn't have any space telescope until
