Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Robert Greenwald. One day, while he was doing an interview in a park in Berlin, a lone man appeared on top of him. The assailant started punching Greenwald with everything he had. When Greenwald managed to get away, the man started throwing rocks. When that didn't work either, he hit him with a metal pipe. He took Greenwald's phone, took him into a park, took his wallet and left him in a pile of trash. This was nearly six years ago, and I think we all know how that went. But Greenwald survived, but his phone is still broken.
