Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jack Sparrow. And that guidance counselor was actually very good at his job. He told Mr. Sparrow, "You're the captain, sir. Don't get lost." And as soon as he said that, Jack Sparrow went on this epic adventure with a crew. And he defeated the Kraken, which everyone thought would end the world, and he ended up saving the universe. That was the start.

So now, Mr. Sparrow, the captain, is gone. He's been gone because the sea has sucked him up. So he's going to get back, but it's going to take him the next 15 years to really start doing all this stuff. He's going to need a crew of his own to take care of people. One of those people is the captain's daughter, Rose. And we find out over the next 15 years that she actually has a great heart behind it all.

The other thing is a guy named Jack Sparrow himself, who we thought was our favorite guy in the world, except he killed a guy named Nathan and went insane. So what happened? No idea. All we know is that he's been floating around with nothing but a scar on his face and he's the leader of the Black Pearl because he's the captain. He's going to need a replacement to help him out. And so he makes that very clear by putting a lot more money into it than anyone anticipated.
