Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Michael Paternostro. Then he retired after 20 years on the force. He now works at a private company that helps companies and nonprofits with tech problems and is looking for more job opportunities.

Recently, I called Michael to see if he wants his own podcast.

The interview took place over Skype, with Michael recording directly into his computer so that it sounded like there was some kind of live interaction going on.

You can listen to the interview below.

Michael Paternostro is an author and podcast host who currently holds the record for largest podcast interview, with more than 25,000 listeners. He is the author of five books, most recently the book on creating a podcast, Secrets to Successful Podcasting in 2017: The 10 Commandments.
