Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Edmund.

Every year, during the time of spring, the butcher would make the rounds of the village. He'd have a big feast at which he'd show off his fine, well-prepared meat.

But one day, Edmund was approached by a new neighbor who asked: "How can I thank your butcher so nicely? He's my new landlord."

So after thanking the butcher, Edmund went up to the neighbor and offered him a knife. The neighbor accepted and said: "I'll pay you five gold coins if you tell me where my sister-in-law is."

So Edmund went to town, and the butcher showed him where the sister lived.

Once a week, the butcher set up a little stand in front of his stand at the corner. He'd bring on the food from the market, and the butcher would pick off some of the best fat, some of the best meat, the best cuts of pork. Then he'd sell it.

When he had a good stock of meat, he'd go around the block, and he'd sell his meat in the markets. The butcher would buy the meat from the markets, and the butcher would be very happy with his sales.
