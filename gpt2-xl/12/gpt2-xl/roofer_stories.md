Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Frank Carver. From his basement, he would build everything in the house, from an indoor jukebox (and still uses the same old records) to a collection of books of nursery rhymes. In 1999, Carver's home studio caught fire as he was setting up equipment, and he escaped the inferno with only minor injuries. The result was The Power of Nightmares, a collection of music that features Frank on guitar and vocals. Carver's music has been described as an album that "captures the spirit of the 80s the best as well as his unique brand of music."


This is the track that Frank released in 2004, and it features Frank on vocals, guitars, bass, drums, and piano.
