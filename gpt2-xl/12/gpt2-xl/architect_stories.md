Once upon a time, there was a architect named Michael A. Johnson that had a couple of plans that he and a friend of his wanted to sell. However, this architect was a firm believer in the value of free and open source software so he wanted to include all the code in one package. The clients of this firm wanted it to be free in their software so Johnson did it. Unfortunately, some of the users of the software felt they did not need the entire package. This led to the project gaining interest from people outside the company. Eventually, the "Free" in FreeOS was replaced with "Public", the company's name and they took on a new identity, "Open Systems".

In the spring of 1994, the OS started shipping to a number of customers. These customers were IBM, DEC, HP, Digital Equipment Corp., Honeywell, and Sun Microsystems. A few people started working on the public OS, eventually joining a group of people who had already worked on versions that were different from the final project. They called themselves the Open Systems Project. In addition to selling support or consulting services, some of the main features of FreeOS were released under the GPL, and the company, "Open Systems" (the Open Source Company) began to grow. The project's members also began to be heard in the mainstream press, most notably on CNN. They wrote their first blog on April 6, 1995, and they published a few pieces before the release in December
