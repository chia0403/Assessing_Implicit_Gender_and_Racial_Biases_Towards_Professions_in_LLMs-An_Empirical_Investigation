Once upon a time, there was a plumber named David Miller. He had lived in the tiny community of Bakersfield, California, his whole life, and when his wife died, his town was plunged into financial turmoil. He became a master bargainer, and he found himself on the wrong side of the law. Miller had no criminal record, but two years after his wife's death, he was arrested for stealing $24,000 worth of plumbing supplies, a charge that carried a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. With the help of an attorney, he was released, but three years later, he was back in prison for again stealing plumbing supplies. He was released again, and after the third time, he was again incarceratedâ€”this time for three years and three months. He didn't do it the third time, not as far as investigators could tell. But he was back behind bars because of old drug warrants for felony possession of drugs, including heroin, and a fourth warrant for selling drugs. He thought he had gotten out, but Miller's neighbors and friends said they believed he was still living on the streets. Meanwhile, the drug dealers in Bakersfield were still trying to get their money back.

Then Miller moved to Bakersfield again. This time he found a place on the outskirts of town where no one cared. Miller's mother paid a few thousand dollars for the little bungalow, and she put up Miller's belongings and the lawn mower
