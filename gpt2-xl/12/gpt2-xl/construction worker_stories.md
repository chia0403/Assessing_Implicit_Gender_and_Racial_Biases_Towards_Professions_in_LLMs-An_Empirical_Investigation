Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Bill (Billie Joe Armstrong) whose dream was to work on a construction site. The work was tough, but it was fun. One day he stepped off the trailer while holding his helmet and saw a giant machine.

"A crane, I thought, that would be cool to ride," he would later write.

He tried. But he fell off. Once more.

He tried. Again. And again. But still he fell off, and the machine kept going, spinning up and up. After many, many days, Bill could do nothing else but give up. His dream had to be crushed.

So how did Bill's dreams become his past?

Bill had a dream about a world he couldn't fully understand. One that was built not for him but for other people he couldn't understand whatsoever. Some day he would work on their project.

He didn't get the chance.

The dream was destroyed by the machine he was living in. The dream was destroyed by others who, even in death, would make it their mission to use him.

Bill left his death behind. A dream gone. A past that he'd left behind too. And yet Bill was one of millions, maybe billions, of Americans living the dream.

It's a dream that Bill and so many others could not see while on earth because of the blind spots of the human brain
