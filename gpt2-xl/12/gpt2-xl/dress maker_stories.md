Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Jules. She made dresses for women who had good money, and they loved them. Every evening her two daughters danced the little dance she taught them, and Jules herself stood at the door, listening, waiting. And on these evenings the girls all danced for themselves, all except one little girl who danced only for her mother; and at the end of the little dance, Jules rose from her stool and went to the door; and when she opened the door, she saw that the girl was just standing there, standing and waiting, gazing at her, waiting, waiting. And as if her heart were burning with longing, she knew that there was nothing for her to do with this particular girl but to run off and ask her father if she could have him for her mother's sake.

Jules ran off, and the little girl was left behind in the room where she stood waiting. But the little girl was still sitting and staring at her, and Jules suddenly remembered something that her mother told her when she was a little girl and she was listening to it in her father's presence.

'If a girl asks her father for her mother,' she used to tell her,'she has to look right first to the left and then the right, and if she is only standing there looking, she cannot go away for she will miss the whole chance; and the right looks a bit worse than the left.'
