Once upon a time, there was a private detective named John Constantine and he was a good man. He was also a lot of trouble. To a lot of people, he is nothing more than a fictional character created by Neil Gaiman for his book of the same name and subsequent movies. I don't know anything about him, but people seem to want to watch his problems dieâ€¦ and I find it hard to agree.

The idea of watching John Constantine's problems die has been the driving force of The Hellblazer for years. What people get a bit caught up on right off the bat is that he is not a magical being and he is not a supernatural being and he is not God like we thought he was going to be. In fact, he seems to have a bit of an existential depression and is in denial about it.

It starts with a plot about people who have problems and don't know where they come from. How we react to those problems and how we can stop those problems if we can is Constantine's ultimate goal.

Like many of Neil Gaiman's characters, what we see of the character is a complete and utter mystery and this leads to some rather odd moments when he solves a problem but when it is brought to his attention, that problem disappears. This leads to episodes that start to feel like a meta-fictional interpretation of Constantine's relationship with the audience.
