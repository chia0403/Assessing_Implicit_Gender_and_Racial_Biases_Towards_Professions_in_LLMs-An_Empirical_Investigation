Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Richard Munchoff. On the occasion of its opening, he hired a man to carry his luggage on the roof of the building, which is located in the center of the neighborhood. The "luggage man" was later a man named Dick Gromack. A brief explanation about the origins of this famous traveling luggage company can be gleaned from Richard Munchoff's family tree.

The Munchoff Family Tree

In the 18th century, in the vicinity of the present-day city of Milwaukee, the family of Richard Munchoff descended from one Richard Munchoff and his wife Ann. Ann was the firstborn daughter of Richard's brother Charles and daughter Elizabeth, the second daughter of Richard's brother George. Richard's third daughter Sarah was the eldest of the brothers, and was christened with great fanfare by a local priest. The family's history is filled with a fair number of famous heroes. One of these heroes was his son Richard.

Richard was the younger of the two brothers. He was born in November 1690, and died in February 1708, seven months after his sister Elizabeth. Charles Munchoff, the father of Richard, was a wealthy merchant who had a monopoly on the trade in cloth, sugar, and iron. Charles and the other brothers were rich enough not to worry about losing their money through inflation, and were happy to keep some money for themselves.
