Recently, he made a comment related to your work:

So Steve, you have a problem. You have two systems in your code that are making you look stupid or stupid. Let's call them User A and User B.

To understand why people make bad code, we need to dig deeper into the problem: User A and User B.

User A is a customer interface for an external web application. Users have a question and they submit it by click of mouse or by send email. User A gives data to User B, and User B gives the answer to the question. User A and User B are two sides of the same coin â€“ one side gives the answer to the user; the other side gets the answer.
