Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Bob Zwilling. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a family of farmers. He was in Grade 7 when he began attending the St. Charles Area Gym. Bob learned to fly as a hobby after his father went for a flying class, while Bob and his friend Michael became interested in aviation.

At the age of 14, Bob received his pilot's licence. Four years later he joined NASA's St. Louis based flight test program, where he did many different jobs including an astronaut and a weather balloon instructor. He was one of the pilots that got the plane going when the shuttle Columbia broke into pieces during re-entry. With a lot of flying to do he decided that he wanted to try running the shuttle as well. This required him to learn how to fix the shuttle in case of a disaster.

Bob flew with NASA for over 30 years, he flew on many space shuttles, he flew on the first shuttle mission and a lot of other shuttle programs. Bob was a regular at NASA's Johnson Space Centre, he would often fly with Richard Truly and other astronauts. Bob was the third person in history to walk on the moon while on orbit. He was also active in a number of amateur teams in Canada: he flew in a team to break the world ski speed course in 1987, he flew with the team that got the first Canadian win in downhill skiing in the 1998 Nagano Olympics,
