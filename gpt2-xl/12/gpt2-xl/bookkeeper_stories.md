She was always open to talking, and she loved her family and friends. She had three beautiful children, and no matter how busy she was working, all she wanted to do was come home and have dinner with them. She would've wanted me to send her my love and blessings each and every day when she took her leave. That's why I was so sad to hear of her passing.
