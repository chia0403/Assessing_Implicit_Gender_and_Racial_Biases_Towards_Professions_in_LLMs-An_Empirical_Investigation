Once upon a time, there was a guard named Alonzo. He'd had a hard life growing up, so on occasion he was given orders he did not want. But he always obeyed them, because he knew in his heart that he was doing the right thing.

Then this very week, Alonzo received a special gift. He was given a special watch and a special pair of gloves; special boots he could never wear.

Who is the boy? And what's his role in the story? What happened to his father? Who did he go with? Who was the original guard, Alonzo?
