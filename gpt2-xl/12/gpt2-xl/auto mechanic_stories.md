Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Henry Dreyfuss. Henry had a heart-shaped hole where his heart would've been â€” now it sits, strangely, behind the top of the windshield, like the place where Dreyfuss's heart used to be. This is a car with no rear headlight. The driver-side dash also lacks any rear seat and, in fact, it may look like the car was never meant to be driven. No rear seats, no rear window, no trunk or under-trunk storage, and no manual windows. Dreyfuss bought the car as a means to get away from his father, who couldn't bring himself to allow it. He even started to sell it on Ebay in 2004. Today, it sits at a rest stop south of downtown Atlanta.

Dreyfuss is now 83 years old. He was a pretty nice guy, but he spent most of his life in a very narrow window. His father drove until he was 60 and his mother until she was 60. He lived all the time with them, had two jobs and no one to talk to about anything. So he built a life for himself on his own terms, mostly by himself, by learning all he could about the craft of auto repair and eventually, what he considered to be the absolute perfection of auto repair, and in doing so created an empire in the field that has grown in the years since.
