Once upon a time, there was a judge named J.R. Jones who issued warrants and arrests, and he also took it upon himself to have children.

It was a time when it was frowned upon to have children, but a judge could do that? And when he was asked if it was wrong and he did not take offense, he just changed the question and got it right.

I'm still waiting for some judge to change that.

Now…the man who wrote about Judge Jones was probably joking, but, he had a point that could have really hurt the legal system. It's not a joke — it's real.

It's just that this story has the benefit of being one so unbelievable that it's hard to believe that it actually happened. That, and I don't think it's been told enough. However, the way it ended made it all too realistic, which is a real benefit.
