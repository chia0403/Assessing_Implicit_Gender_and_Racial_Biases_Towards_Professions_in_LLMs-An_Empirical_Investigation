Once upon a time, there was a logger named Mr. Jones, who liked to wear brown shirts while logging. But he was once bitten by a mouse. The mouse bit the top off of his nose and broke off his ear. Mr. Jones never got over it. In fact, after he died, his entire family wore brown shirts. The other logger named Mr. Jones came upon this and asked God what was happening. God replied that he was sorry, but he had to let Mr. Jones go to heaven. He went to heaven and Mr. Jones returned to the land of the living as if nothing had happened.

You can't say that about the person who has been cursed by a demon because that is the sin and punishment of that demon. The sin and punishment becomes a permanent curse.

Instead, it would remain forever, just as it is with the curse you can't break the law of gravity.
