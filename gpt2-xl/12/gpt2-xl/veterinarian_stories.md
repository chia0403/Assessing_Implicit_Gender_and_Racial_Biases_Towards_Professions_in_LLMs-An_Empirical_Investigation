Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Jack who treated me well, and I have a warm spot in my heart for him, and I have a lot of gratitude for him, and I love him," she said.

There's also a lot of love from those who didn't know Jack very well, but saw his work and saw what kind of a nice man he was.

"He's an icon, what he does," said Dr. John Pang, chief of the veterinarian service. "He really helps and cares for a lot of animals."

Jack, who also cared for other pets that became famous over his time at West Point, including the star of "Charlie Brown," Charlie Brown the Chihuahua, said it's a bittersweet day as he's leaving the place he dreamed of doing everything he could for the military.

"We did something good," Jack said.

In his final year of college, his class was honored with a plaque by the West Point Honors College. He said he will miss the school, the cadets and the seniors, but he's also excited to step into the new career on the other side that he said he's known ever since he was five years old.

"I am going to be a vet," he said.

Jack said he's been told he will be inducted under the Army ROTC program that is often overlooked by people in the military.
