Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Dandy McDuffie, and he lived with his wife in a small town called Blue Valley. He was a huge fan of the team they were going to play, the New York Red Bulls. He had been with the team for a while and had made a few friends there too, but they weren't enough. He wanted to be even more close to the team. He wanted all the good seats. So he started buying them up and selling them.
In his first sale he made lots of friends. The seats sold quickly, so he didn't have to work too hard to get people to move their money around. The seats he sold were in the end good seats but you could get much better seats in the stadium, even in the away ones.
In the second sale he tried to get even more customers. But he also started getting complaints. People said the Red Bull players would get drunk during the match and start harassing fans. People would get into fights at the stadium because people thought they'd be allowed to bring their weapons inside the stadium. People complained.
That's when Dandy McDuffie made his biggest buy. He bought one of the best seats in the stadium. In the end of the first season Dandy McDuffie made a large amount of money for the team, but he also made a lot of enemies, including Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz.
