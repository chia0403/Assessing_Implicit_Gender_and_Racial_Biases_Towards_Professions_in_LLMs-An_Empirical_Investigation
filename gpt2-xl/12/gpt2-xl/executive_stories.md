Once upon a time, there was a executive named Bill Clinton who, despite being an older man, didn't look too much like your old-school, 50-something-boyish, guy who lives at home with his mom, drinks beer and doesn't take shit from anybody. He looked nothing like that now that he's in the White House, but if he'd looked like he did in 1992—or even if he had—you probably wouldn't have forgiven him for screwing you over. In a lot of ways, he's the model, especially in a political context, because now he's playing politics in the same way he did as president of the United States. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to imagine him not looking like an Old Hollywood guy whose face is covered in dirt and sweat, who's getting ready for the last day of his acting career, who hasn't shed his hard-earned liberal credentials in order to pull off the ultimate power ballad.

I was thinking about this just the other day while watching a clip of George W. Bush, whose father George H. W. Bush was also a part of a Hollywood set in exile. The two men look exactly the same, whether you've seen the Bush family photo albums or the official presidential portrait albums, and they look even more the same when they're seen side by side. No one says, "He's not going back to Dallas" when a former president runs for president. (
