Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jacques Lassiter. After years of being chased out of his restaurant, he opened a bistro in the woods behind his home. There, he raised a small herd of deer that he fed to the birds and the squirrels and other small animals in the woods, until the entire village, including the Prince of Denmark, agreed to buy him a place in the capital to continue his great experiment. All the townspeople, as well as his employees, were invited to his own house for dinner and a special show. And everything was fine, and everyone liked each other, until one day, when the Prince took a fancy to the "Culinary Prince Jacques", he invited him and some of his staff to accompany him on his ship to another planet by the name of Lala.

The Prince's ship had a secret compartment to store his delicious cheese cheese, but the Culinary Prince was the third person in that compartment. He decided to open the secret compartment and see it for himself, but when he was opening this secret compartment to eat some cheese, he got stuck. He couldn't get much further, or he'd get stuck, or he'd get stuck all the way back on his planet, so he got stuck. So that means his only hope is to find a way to open the door without getting stuck, but he can't open that door, because it's locked. What's up with the lock on
