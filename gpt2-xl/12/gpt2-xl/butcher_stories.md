Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Algernon Blackwood who lived on an island off of the coast of England. He had a wife named Edith, and a son named Blackwood. They had three servants named Tom, Peter and John. All of the servants loved Algernon, except for three named Tom, Peter and John. Each served a different function for both of them: Tom was their butler in their house, Peter was their housekeeper and John was their son, though he did not go to a formal school.

One day, Algernon and Edith were having an argument on their way home from the bazaar. They both told Algernon the reasons for why they got into the argument. Algernon then told Edith that their servant Tom would never know why he did not come home for a while. Edith gave a sad sigh and then told Algernon that the three of them didn't need the butler anyway.

"Don't I need your butler?" Algernon asked. Edith then told Algernon they did and asked you to be a man and follow her to the forest. She would be waiting for him there.

"Why?" Algernon asked.

"Because she loves you," she said. "Don't be afraid."
