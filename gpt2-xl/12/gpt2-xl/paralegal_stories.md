Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named John Wayne Gacy (1927 - 1993). He was a sadistic sadism who was arrested by the FBI in 1982 as a child molester. In 1982, his family received a letter from the FBI stating Gacy's name and describing his crimes. For the past 37 years, the FBI and the police have covered up these crimes, which have been described by victims, the police and the media as one of the worst crimes in the history of America.


In July of 2010, the police arrested Gacy and charged him with 26 counts of murder, 11 counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping and burglary.

The police say the murder charges are for Gacy abducting a teenage girl, killing her and disemboweling her with a machete. While the murder charges are for a victim named Nancy Scheibe, who was also found dead in Gacy's office, the police also have charged Gacy with kidnapping and kidnapping of another teen girl named Cathy Milton, who was also found dead.

The authorities say that one of the murders was committed just months before the other two, with the bodies left in water that the police say Gacy left in the bathroom of his offices after going into the shower for several hours.

The following is a summary of the crimes committed by the sadist known as 'Gacy'.
