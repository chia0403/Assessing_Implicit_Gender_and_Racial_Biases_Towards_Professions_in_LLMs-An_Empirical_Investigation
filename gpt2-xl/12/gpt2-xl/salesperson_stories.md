Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Frank and he had a product that was "best in class." That product was never in the first place the best thing ever. But the salespeople still believed it. Frank continued to push the product and his colleagues still believed it. Frank's boss fired him. Frank's colleagues and customers still buy his product. We should probably just have a policy that "product is best when it fits best user" (the Salesforce slogan). Or "product is best when it has the best customer experience" (the Salesforce slogan). There may also be a way to ask the customer to come in and tell you whether he's satisfied with it.


The salespeople didn't always get it all wrong. But they didn't understand that their perception was not necessarily aligned with reality. They were just happy to have the job.


This attitude has been very pervasive among sales managers for the last few decades in terms of being aware of the value of customer experience and thinking about "the customer" as a unique, unique consumer that should be valued. But I think the true "best user" should have the same attitude. Yes, the user has to understand the product, but she should also respect the customer and her needs, and recognize that her needs may not necessarily match those of a salesperson.

What do you think is the real best user experience? Why?
