Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Jerry. For some reason I thought this was a funny story. I had no idea how Jerry was involved in the bar's financial well-being. So, I asked for Jerry's permission to use the name I had decided was the perfect name for the bar: Jerry's Bar.

From the Jerry's Bar Website:

Jerry grew up in Chicago's South Side neighborhood and was born in Brooklyn. As a young man, Jerry worked at a New York City bar, until he came across an ad for a job at a tavern. After several months of work there, Jerry's Bar was born. He now owns the business with his wife, and we are happy to report that Jerry's Bar is the number one Bar in the world!

This is actually a fictional character created by Jim Meehan who used his brother's story to create one of the oldest known satirical websites on the Internet â€“ The Onion. The name "Jerry" came from the bar's location in North Lawndale, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side with a long legacy of working class, Irish immigrant drinking traditions.

Since Jerry's Bar is a fictional bar, you can have it open later than it would be open at real life, since the author made the bar his own.
