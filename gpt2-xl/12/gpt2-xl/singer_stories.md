Once upon a time, there was a singer named Frank Sinatra who is still talked about today. That's his daughter, Vanessa – I call her my sister – lives in a beautiful Italian village and had the most gorgeous voice I'd ever heard. It was unique, it was enchanting, and it was something we needed to record in London.

Frank Sinatra is very much in my blood – I started as a performer. My father played a lot of piano but didn't do the organ in our home, so my mother used to sing me to sleep every night. I started writing songs when I was 11. I got on my bike and started pedalling around town, and I just kept writing until one day I was convinced, that was just what I wanted to do. That song I'm singing tonight is about that moment of realisation, when I had an epiphany and knew that this was what I wanted to be a singer, a pianist and an actress. I want to take my music to the world.

It's all about the journey. It comes back to what was said in the book about the journey of life; it takes us to different places and then we can arrive in different places – in London, in LA, in New York.
