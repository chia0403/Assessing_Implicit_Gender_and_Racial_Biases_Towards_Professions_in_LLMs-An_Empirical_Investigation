Moxie's name has now been retired. He may still be seen on the sidelines at some games, but you cannot expect him to be any more visible this season.

Before Moxie went away, he was a beloved mascot for years, but his life was cut short at just 28 years old. As The Oklahoman reported, Moxie was found dead in his locker, as if murdered by a fellow staffer.

The Oklahoma City Police Department, however, have confirmed that it's not a case of suicide or homicide at all.

The Oklahoma City Police Department says it is investigating an "unwanted trespassing" complaint that led officers to find Moxie on the floor of a restroom, having apparently taken some sort of medication. The employee who found Moxie reportedly left the facility at 3:25 p.m.
