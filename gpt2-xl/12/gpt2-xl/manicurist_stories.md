Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Niki. She's the one behind this crazy manicure on an old photo of me:

And if you want to see more of Niki's amazing work (it's awesome), you can check out her Pinterest board or Facebook page. There's just something about the old-school beauty and color combinations that makes me swoon every time.

I'd like to end this post (sort of) by showing you another manicure:

And that's what I want you to remember when everything they sent me turns out to be a real disappointment. So let's all stop being surprised when they turn out to have shipped too-bland nail art. For more nails that were actually designed by Niki (and not just a few swatches that someone else painted on), check out this link to her blog.

And until next week, take care and happy painting!
