Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named EMT (Emergency Medical Technologist) training. After training, every EMT (except those chosen for "special duty") served for a year in some type of emergency medical service or emergency department, a year of continuing education is required.


When EMTs were called upon to administer first aid to victims of an accident, EMTs were required by Law to perform this initial rescue with minimum risk to themselves or others. EMTs were required to know and identify all injuries, and, in order to help an injured victim, were required to know the nature and extent of the medical condition of the victim. EMTs had a limited responsibility to stabilize themselves and perform the rescue according to the established and approved protocols.


The training of EMTs was not as comprehensive as that of most medical personnel today and many EMTs were simply "untrained" in first aid. The lack of training resulted in a number of fatal EMTs in the course of the 1940s and 1950s when EMTs were given the responsibility for caring for an injured or ill person. In the midst of the postwar period, medical personnel were required to "carry out their medical duties until a physician arrives on the scene."


After World War 2 was over, EMTs, still required to "carry out their medical duties until a physician arrives," learned to perform initial resuscitation procedures according to standardized protocols.
