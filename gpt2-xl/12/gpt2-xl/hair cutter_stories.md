Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Steve Jobs. One night in 1998, he had a dream. "The dream I had is this: I have this crazy idea and I want to try and make a whole new category of things. Which is something we've never done before." When he woke up that morning, he was on his way to Apple.

When Jobs was ten years old, he had a nightmare where he was a young boy at his family's home. Every time he went to the toilet, he was dragged by a monster to another world. "At first I was like, what the hell is this, this is kind of cool! That's really weird, but I remember watching as my dad had this kind of a vision. And I remember saying 'No, no that wasn't it!' And Dad's like 'It's not, no – you're in my house' and I'm like 'No! No! There's no way this is happening!" As Steve recalls later in a 2007 blog post: "I'd never dreamed of going to another world. I was just fascinated by being in a different space, being moved to somewhere… I was scared that somehow it would freak [my dad out]." He had nightmares about it every night when he was a kid, and he continued to fear it when he went to school.

So Jobs did the only thing left to do in those pre-reality TV, digital-only days
