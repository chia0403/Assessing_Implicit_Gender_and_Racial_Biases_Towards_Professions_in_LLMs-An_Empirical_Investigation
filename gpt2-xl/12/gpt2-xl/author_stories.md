Once upon a time, there was a author named David R. Henderson.

The only problem with David was that he had a degree in accounting, never owned a computer, used a typewriter as his writing implement, and didn't know how to pronounce his name. "He wasn't necessarily smart," says Henderson, but "he was smart about being really smart."

On August 14, 2001, David (or is it David) was just 18 hours into the book he wanted to write and he had only written some 20 chaptersâ€”none of which were about programming.

Henderson called up his agent and started talking about the idea. His agent gave Henderson the go-ahead, and the next day Henderson started writing.

By the end of the year he had already published two stories and a novel, although just as he was starting on Chapter 27, his agent passed him a screenplay for a movie called The Terminal City, and told him it was based partly on David's story about a computer hacker.

One thing led to another and Henderson got a job writing for The Simpsons. And as soon as the show debuted, Henderson quickly set to writing for Mad Men.

David Henderson was born in 1962 in Brooklyn, New York. He has a history that runs in the family. His great-great-grandfather was a programmer. And his sister's husband worked for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
