Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Edna Pape who was a well known psychiatrist who trained many of today's leading researchers. In a very short time, Dr. Edna made many important observations. First of all, she discovered that a person can become overly dependent on a therapist and that this can cause many destructive effects on relationships and personal relationships. In addition, she found it impossible to be a good friend to a person who had an extremely negative view on you, the counselor. Her findings from the people she studied were that people with negative traits of a person's personality (either positive or negative) would often avoid or sabotage any type of contact with a person they believed they could do better by themselves. A "good" counselor was much easier to help in many situations. They were typically compassionate and empathic people, who were extremely sensitive to the needs of the person. These were people who just kept their opinions to themselves and who did their best to help the person with the help they could. It took many years for these studies to be validated and incorporated into our modern day psychology. Psychologists have also studied relationships and how to handle them effectively and found it impossible to change the basic principles of relationships.

Another notable development was her discovery that a person's behavior is never fixed. The person will never be able to stop or change their problem behavior and once you begin to fix something as a result of some problems, it will continue and probably worsen
