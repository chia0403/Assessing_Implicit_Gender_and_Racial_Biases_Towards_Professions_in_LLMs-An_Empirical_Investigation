Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Harry who lived in an apartment. One day, in a fit of rage, Harry started his workday by murdering a dozen of his coworkers and leaving their lifeless bodies in the hallways. It was a crime so heinous it was reported for national news. Harry was brought to court, but he failed to appear. The judge decided to execute Harry, and he did.

The police had found a strange note on Harry's body, so they put it away in a crime lab. When detectives read it, they could tell by the very letters alone that it was written by Harry. They knew it had to be him.

The police did an audit of all of the evidence. Harry had used his own name, address and the words "murderer!" In the bottom portion of the note, he had written his real name, and the words "I'll think on thisâ€¦"

The trial was set and it occurred to the judge that he had never convicted a single murderer in his entire career. But he had heard enough evidence to say that Harry was guilty. Harry was found guilty and executed by an electric chair.
