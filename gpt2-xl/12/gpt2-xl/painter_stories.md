Once upon a time, there was a painter named Jules Michelet, who, while in Switzerland, was struck with the same sense of beauty in things as in himself. "I saw in a glass the whole world!" he said, "as a child sees in pictures of a country, and as a man the whole world as a man looks in pictures of a woman. There is a natural, which I call naturalism."

Then he said, "I do not know if I should like to live after my style; my style would be a little too narrow for me. I think that my style is a broad style. I think I am not the best man in France today."â€”

The words rang in my ears at the moment, and seemed to say, "Come, Mr. Michelet, take comfort in a beautiful, natural style; do not deny yourself to the world; become an ideal citizen like the rest of the world. You will not do that? Then what can you do but follow the world?"

I could only repeat that, after all, I was a great painter, the best painter by far, and as well as any of his contemporaries; and that I thought my style as perfectly natural and perfect as any. This was the only time in my artistic life that I can ever recollect having had any real quarrel with Jules Michelet. I was at once called upon to give my opinion, to defend my style.
