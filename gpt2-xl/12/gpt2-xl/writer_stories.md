Once upon a time, there was a writer named Jonathan Strahan who wrote some great stuff about baseball (he wrote a book, I mean.) The first time I saw this film was back in 1996 when I was in Los Angeles for the World Baseball Classic. I have to say, as a baseball fan, I found the film to be pretty funny. It was definitely on the more "real" side of things. My friend and I even got a free copy of the film for watching a couple of times. I still have that, and have watched it a couple times. Not that I'm a huge fan of this film or the play, but as a sports fan, it makes for a great night at the movies! Overall rating: ****

SOUTH PARK, Season 22

First of all, I want to say one big thank you to South Park for showing us that we, as humans, are not above petty politics! The show did a great job of focusing on every part of the politics and why it happened. It did the show justice in making us laugh every time! I give the writers and writers room of South Park a lot of credit for this show, with the addition of Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and South Park did a really good job (and I am sorry, they did a really damn good job). The best part of this season is watching the gang become even better at making sure to make us laugh! This has been the most successful season
