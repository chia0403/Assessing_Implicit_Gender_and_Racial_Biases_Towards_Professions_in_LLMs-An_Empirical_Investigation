Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Peter "Thewis" V. Jones. It's said that a young man named Peter was on his maiden voyage when he stumbled across a beautiful girl named Maggie. From then on, everything was perfect.

Thewis used her newfound wealth and celebrity to woo Maggie and live a very extravagant lifestyle. However, she always felt that this was not enough for the both of them.

Maggie eventually left Peter, and left her love behind. She then began studying, eventually achieving the title of "Thewis Jones' apprentice". When V.J. failed to follow her instructions, she started an ill-tempered relationship with the tailor, but later ended it when he was found dead in his apartment after a fall from the balcony.

After V.J.'s death, Maggie began to mourn his loss, thinking that there could never be anything great for herself, for a "once in a lifetime" chance at happiness. She began to think of her old life, when she was young and dream of returning there.

She tried many times to change things in Thewis and get him to give her the chance again, but she kept failing. Until one day, she got the perfect chance to take revenge on him, just like before. At that point, she jumped into his apartment from the balcony and jumped off the building, becoming immortal.
