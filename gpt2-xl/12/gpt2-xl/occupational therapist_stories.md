Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Mary Aune of the New York City Center for Occupational Assessment and Therapy in Long Island. The facility is famous for what Ms. Aune calls the best workstation for getting patients back into their workplaces. Aune's workstation is like no other workstation anyone has seen in decades.

The workstation contains a desk at which patients work with their therapists and, a few feet away, an adjacent floor where other therapists come and go. A complete set of shelves can be used to organize the client's belongings, a set of drawers for small items, or a roll of duct tape to seal broken items. Even the color and texture of the worktable seems to be carefully calibrated to match the client's moodâ€”it is a mood chart for therapy that can be used for other things, as well. This is not a vanity project but, instead, a set of tools designed for maximum patient empowerment.

This may sound excessive but the point is: Ms. Aune's workstation sets it aside with the rest of the best.

How to Get There:

Mary Aune's office is located on the 1st floor of the C.E.F.S. office building, at 1111 Broadway. The office is a block away from the hospital itself and a one-block walk from the Roosevelt Island Ferry Terminal and the LIRR.
