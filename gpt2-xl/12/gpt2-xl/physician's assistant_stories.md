Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Einar Aason, an immigrant from Norway who settled in Queens and got his start in dentistry.

But he eventually got fed up â€” not so much with his work but with his supervisor.

The dentist insisted on making himself indispensable by insisting that Aason provide a variety of dental services for free, Aason told the New York Times' Amy Harmon.

"It just became a situation where we had to provide a lot of free work every week," Aason said. "And so what I did was I quit. I wrote a letter saying I thought I was going to leave for another position here. But then I realized I can't stay here. If you can't stay here, you can't stay anywhere."

In the year since, the dentist, who is not named in the article, has gone on to have a stellar dental career.

His reputation on Long Island is such that, when he was named the region's second most prolific dentist by the Daily News in 2013 (ahead of Dr. George Lontofo), he had to put a stop to his phone calls.

"People would call and say, oh my gosh; here's my father. He just had surgery yesterday! So, yes, the letters have stopped. But if they ever call again, I'll say, 'My God, can you please let me die?'" he told Harmon.
