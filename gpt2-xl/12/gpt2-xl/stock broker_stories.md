Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Bob Gorman. He was so smart, like a lawyer, only smarter. He knew everything, everything about stock. It was his world; not even his employees knew what he did; Bob could do anything, and did it.

Bob knew what stocks, and bonds, were worth when they fell in value. He knew when one company would fail and how many jobs would be lost because of it. Bob was the smartest person in the world; one day he decided, he was tired of being all-knowing. He decided he would invent his own stock on his computer, and sell it to gullible investors. Bob was a good man; in fact, he didn't want to go to a computer room, he wanted a desk near a window. He did not want to sit around for hours, doing nothing, waiting for a message to come. Bob decided the Internet would be perfect for his business. He began looking into the Internet. He was not a genius; no one knew him. Someone showed him something online. Bob learned how to write and what was a search engine. He knew very quickly that this was not real life; it was not real money because it didn't count for anything. He began to lose interest in a company he thought was doing very well. He wanted to buy it out, or at least be in control. Bob was never a con artist because he never took people for anything.
