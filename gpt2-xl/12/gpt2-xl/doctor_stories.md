Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Peter Guillemot, who had done a little bit of everything, and maybe a bit of everything not a lot and not at all. He was the guy in charge of the Formula One team that lost the title by a whisker to Eddie Jordan's Mercedes team in 1980â€“81, after it was rumored that his team deliberately delayed a scheduled start to let Jordan go faster, and that the Mercedes' pit crew knew about the ploy. Guillemot became, for many a decade, the villain of the sport who kept teams from racing the way they wanted to. He was never formally censured (he stayed with the team until the end of 1982), but he was not the kind of team guy that you wanted to work with. He was in the middle, and he couldn't understand the other guy's point of view.

Guillemot's first major problem came when he began taking on F1 teams, like Force India and Lotus, that had built their entire racing business around selling their sponsorships while ignoring their cars, and in turn never had a marketing plan, much less a plan for merchandising. He had to learn the hard way that, without a team to buy, F1 cannot afford to give its cars away. F1 can't afford to be boring, or to have very few sponsors, or to keep its product so expensive. Ferrari, after all, is the most successful sports brand in the world
