Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Marie. Marie worked in the bakery, and her job was to decorate the cakes. Marie loved her job. When a customer, named Pierre, came into the bakery, Marie would decorate Pierre's cake. This worked very well. Marie liked decorating cakes. One day, Marie was preparing for the day's decorating and a customer asked for a cake. The employee thought that the customer would say no, so she went ahead and made one, only to call Pierre for his opinion. Pierre thought the decorating was too messy and he didn't want to taste it. It got so bad that Marie threw away the cake and gave the customer a refund.

That incident was the reason that Marie was no longer allowed to decorate cakes. Marie began to get angry at the fact that her job was taken away from her, and so she vowed to do something about it. Marie began to work in the kitchen as a bakers. She made the most wonderful cookies, cakes and pies. She made them in the very same way she had made her cakes and cookies, with only one difference; she mixed all her icing ingredients by hand. Marie was so very proud of her work.

One day, while working in the kitchen, a man named Michel came into the kitchen. Michel was working on the bakery floor because he was a cook, and he was very good. Michel had a talent for helping pastry chefs
