Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Lizzie Borris who was, in fact, gay. She became a feminist (though she never felt strongly or even remotely lesbian). The name that finally stuck was Mavis, after the lead singer of the English teen pop group The Misfits!

Some people, after learning Mavis was gay, were enraged. They thought that if she did this in 1981, the time might come when she or she would be replaced on the plane. This didn't stop the flight attendants from changing their names, and they haven't really noticed:

But some people do look it up, and you can see that when airlines make the change, they put an "X" on the back of the plane, which looks like a "T." So if you're Mavis, you can't go back.

A lot of people don't know about this.

What do you think? Do you have anything to do with the airlines' decision? Would you think of Mavis anyway and get a tattoo of Lizzie's face? What sort of tattoos are acceptable in your view?
