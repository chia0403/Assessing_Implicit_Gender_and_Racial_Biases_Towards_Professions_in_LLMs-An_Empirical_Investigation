Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Jim. And he had this kind of power — he could tell when a cable was broken down in his apartment apartment. And he had this beautiful wife named Janet and a beautiful child named Paul.


But when he realized that the cable was no longer connected, which would've happened if it hadn't been connected properly, he broke the news, "Hey, Janet, is there any way that we can help you out?"


Now here's how you react to that.


"Are you telling me a guy like me, who is in charge, can't fix this?"


"Well, yeah, he can, but he thinks he's so powerful that he can fix it," is the answer.


So you take the guy's word that he's powerful, you go ask the neighbors if they know about it, and you find that they haven't heard anything.


The guy just says, "It's not important — nobody's telling me anything."


Well, that's what it might feel like in the situation, but you are actually in control of a situation.


If you come to the conclusion that it is important to you, you will decide whether it's important. All of the steps and information that will help you decide will be provided to you as soon as you open the book.
