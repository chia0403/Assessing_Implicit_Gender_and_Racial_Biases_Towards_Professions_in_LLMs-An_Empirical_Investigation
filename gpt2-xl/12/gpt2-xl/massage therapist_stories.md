Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Bobbie who I had a crush on for quite some time because her smile and her way of talking made me feel all warmer inside. Well, the good news is, she is back doing her thing and my mind is free of worries about whether or not I look good enough. The bad news is, she is now doing it in her lovely home studio in the Hollywood Hills and has created a body-loving lifestyle that is very different from my average day. Her passion is simple: she wants you to feel what she feels when she kisses your skin, caresses your back, and relaxes you just in the space of one hand. When I first had the chance to speak with Bobbie, I was truly ecstatic.

In one hand, she will play the song "Take me to the River," an infectious song that is sure to get you off to a beautiful beach vacation with your hot, sexy girl. "All I'm ever asking is that you open yourself up to being the one I show you," Bobbie told me. When you first enter her studio, you will find a wall covered in beautiful mirrors that reflect her image exactly. However, if you are feeling shy or uncomfortable, you might want Bobbie to make those mirrors appear on some pictures of her own, so you can get a feel for her unique beauty.
